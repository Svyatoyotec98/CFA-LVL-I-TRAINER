Portfolios to the right of the minimum-variance frontier typically involve higher levels of risk for potentially higher returns. A risk-averse investor, by definition, seeks to minimize risk, not necessarily to maximize returns at the cost of taking on more risk. Therefore, such an investor would prefer portfolios on the minimum-variance frontier itself, where the risk is minimized for any level of expected return, rather than opting for higher-risk options to the right of the frontier.",

Portfolios on this frontier offer the lowest possible risk for a given level of expected return, aligning perfectly with the preferences of a risk-averse investor.

The capital market theory suggests that the optimal portfolio is one that efficiently balances expected return and risk, which is achieved through diversification.

However, negative covariance specifically indicates a type of linear relationship where the returns of the two assets move in opposite directions. Uncorrelated assets have a covariance of zero, meaning that the return of one asset provides no information about the return of the other. This is distinctly different from a negative covariance, which does provide information about the relationship between the returns of two assets."

          "correct_answer": "C",
          "explanation": "Small-cap stocks are generally considered to have a greater return and a higher risk compared to T-Bills and large-cap stocks. This is primarily due to the nature of small-cap companies, which are smaller in market capitalization. These companies often operate in niche markets or are in the early stages of development, making them more susceptible to market volatility and economic changes. However, this also means they have a higher potential for growth compared to larger, more established companies. Historically, small-cap stocks have shown higher returns over the long term, albeit with higher volatility and risk. This higher risk and return profile is attributed to the fact that small-cap companies can rapidly grow in value, but they can also face significant challenges that can adversely affect their stock prices.",
          "explanation_wrong": {
            "A": "T-Bills, or Treasury Bills, are short-term government securities that are considered to be one of the safest investments since they are backed by the full faith and credit of the U.S. government. Due to their low risk, T-Bills typically offer lower returns compared to stocks.",
            "B": "Large-cap stocks represent companies with large market capitalizations and are generally considered to be more stable and less volatile than small-cap stocks. These companies are often leaders in their industries, with established business models and consistent revenue streams. While large-cap stocks can offer solid returns and are an essential part of a diversified investment portfolio, they typically do not offer the same growth potential as small-cap stocks. The lower risk associated with large-cap stocks usually translates to lower volatility and, consequently, lower returns compared to small-cap stocks. Investors looking for growth might prefer small-cap stocks despite the higher risk, while those seeking stability might lean towards large-cap stocks."

This metric is a way to determine if a portfolio is outperforming the market-adjusted for its level of systematic risk. Jensen's alpha takes into account the portfolio's sensitivity to market movements, as represented by its beta, to isolate the portion of returns attributable to the portfolio manager's active decision-making.

In a defined contribution plan, only contributions to the account are guaranteed, not the future benefits. It is a retirement plan in the employee’s name usually funded by both the employee and the employer.

            "A": "Hedge funds usually have restricted liquidity, which is a characteristic feature of these investment vehicles. Unlike mutual funds or exchange-traded funds (ETFs), hedge funds often impose lock-up periods during which investors cannot withdraw their capital. These lock-up periods can range from a few months to several years, depending on the specific hedge fund's strategy and structure. Additionally, even after the lock-up period, withdrawals may only be permitted at certain intervals, such as quarterly or semi-annually.

The management fee is typically a fixed percentage of the assets under management (AUM), usually ranging from 1% to 2% annually. The performance fee, on the other hand, is a feature that aligns the interests of the hedge fund managers with those of the investors. This fee is a percentage of the fund's profits, often around 20%, and is only charged if the fund achieves a certain level of performance. This fee structure incentivizes managers to seek the highest possible returns for their investors, as their compensation is directly tied to the fund's success.

Within an asset class, investments tend to be more closely related in terms of their risk and return characteristics. For instance, different stocks within the technology sector may have low correlation with each other, but they are still subject to the same sector-specific risks. Therefore, diversification within an asset class, although beneficial, is limited in its ability to reduce risk compared to diversification across different asset classes.",
            "C": "High correlation between asset classes is detrimental to diversification benefits. When asset classes move in the same direction at the same time, the risk of the portfolio tends to be higher, and the potential for mitigating losses through diversification is reduced. In extreme cases, if all asset classes in a portfolio are highly correlated and experience a downturn simultaneously, the portfolio could suffer significant losses.

            "B": "The assertion that insurance companies have high liquidity needs as compared to endowment funds is accurate. Insurance companies, especially those dealing with life, property, and casualty insurance, face uncertain timing and amounts of claims. This uncertainty necessitates maintaining a higher level of liquidity to ensure that claims can be paid out promptly, regardless of when they arise. Endowment funds, on the other hand, have a more predictable and stable payout structure, typically aimed at funding specific long-term objectives such as scholarships or institutional support. This allows endowment funds to allocate a larger portion of their portfolio to less liquid, potentially higher-yielding investments, as their need for immediate liquidity is generally lower than that of insurance companies."

The investor's substantial net assets and the long time horizon until retirement clearly indicate a high ability to take on financial risks. However, his beliefs about the stock market and preference for less volatile stocks reflect a cautious approach to investing, indicating a low willingness to take on risk. The investor's financial situation and safety nets like social security support a high ability to absorb risk, but his personal beliefs and investment preferences suggest a reluctance to engage in high-risk investment strategies."

VaR does not predict the maximum loss but rather the minimum loss at a certain confidence level. Therefore, stating it as a \"maximum\" loss does not accurately represent the concept of VaR, which is focused on the threshold that losses are not expected to exceed only 7% of the time, implying that losses could be greater than $600 million but not less, within the specified period.",

It indicates the risk of experiencing a loss of at least $600 million within a one-month period, but it does not guarantee that such a loss will happen in the next month.

The main goal is not to minimize all risks but to manage them in a way that balances risk with opportunity. Excessive risk aversion can hinder a company's ability to innovate and grow. Therefore, the risk management process focuses on making informed decisions that allow the company to pursue strategic opportunities while managing the associated risks in a way that is aligned with the company's overall objectives and risk appetite.

The key is in assessing the potential benefits against the risks to ensure that the decisions made are in the best interest of the company and its stakeholders.
