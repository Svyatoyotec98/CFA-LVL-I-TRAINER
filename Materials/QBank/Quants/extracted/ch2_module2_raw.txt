Learning	Module	2:	The	Time	Value	of	Money	in	Finance
Q.8	
If	you	invest	$100,000	currently	in	a	project	paying	an	8%	interest	rate	compounded
annually,	the	amount	of	the	investment	after	three	years	is	
closest	to
:
The	correct	answer	is	
C.
	
The	question	requires	the	calculation	of	the	future	value	of	a	single-sum	investment.	Recall	that
future	value	is	the	total	to	which	a	present	deposit	will	grow	over	time	when	placed	in	an
account	paying	compound	interest.
The	formula	for	calculating	FV	is	as	follows:
Where:
FV	=	Future	Value,
PV	=	Present	Value	of	the	investment.
I/Y	=	Rate	of	return	per	compounding	period.
N	=	Total	number	of	compounding	periods.
Therefore;
A	is	incorrect.
	It	represents	the	amount	after	one	year	using	simple	interest	as	follows:
B	is	incorrect.
	The	calculation	divides	the	interest	(8%)	by	the	number	of	compounding	periods
(3	years)	as	follows:

Q.11	
How	much	is	an	asset	worth	today,	if	it	is	supposed	to	pay	$7,000	per	year	for	10	years?
The	first	payment	is	due	one	year	from	now	and	the	required	rate	is	6%	per	year.
The	correct	answer	is	
B.
	
The	question	requires	the	calculation	of	the	Present	Value	of	an	ordinary	annuity	as	follows:
Where;
A	=	Amount	of	the	annuity.

Q.34	
You	have	a	choice	to	take	your	retirement	benefit	either	as	a	lump-sum	or	as	an	annuity.	You
can	take	a	lump-sum	of	$4.5	million	or	an	annuity	with	15	payments	of	$400,000	a	year	with	the
first	payment	starting	t	=1.	The	interest	rate	is	7%	per	year	compounded	annually.	Which	option
is	preferable,	on	the	basis	that	it	has	the	greater	present	value?
The	correct	answer	is	
B.
	
The	question	requires	calculating	the	present	value	of	a	series	of	equal	cash	flows	compared	to
the	lump	sum	payment.	The	annuity	payment	qualifies	as	an	ordinary	annuity	since	it	has	equal
annuity	payments,	with	the	first	payment	starting	at	time	t=1.	Hence	the	formula	is	as	follows:
N=	15;	I/Y=	7;	PMT=400,000;	FV	=	0;	CPT	=>	PV	=	3,643,165.60
The	total	annuity	payment	amount	of	$3,643,165.60	is	less	than	the	lump	sum	payment	of	$4.5
million;	hence	settle	for	a	lump	sum	payment.
A	is	incorrect
.	The	present	value	of	the	lump	sum	is	greater	than	the	present	value	of	the
annuity	payments,	as	evidenced	in	Choice	B.
C	is	incorrect
.The	present	value	of	the	lump	sum	is	greater	than	the	present	value	of	the
annuity	payments.

Q.35	
XYZ	Pension	Fund	plans	to	pay	its	retirees	a	total	of	$29	million	every	year	beginning	in
2017.	The	payments	will	be	made	at	the	end	of	each	year	until	2031	for	a	total	of	15	payments.
Assuming	a	discount	rate	of	4%	compounded	annually,	the	present	value	of	the	pension	payments
to	the	retirees	in	2017	is	
closest	to
:
The	correct	answer	is	
B.
	
The	question	requires	calculating	the	Present	Value	of	an	ordinary	annuity	whereby	the	annuity
makes	N	payments,	with	the	first	payment	at	t	=	1	and	the	last	at	t	=	N.
The	present	value	of	an	ordinary	annuity	can	be	expressed	as	the	sum	of	the	present	values	of
each	annuity	payment	as	follows,
Where;
A	=	the	annuity	amount.
r	=	The	interest	rate	per	period	corresponding	to	the	frequency	of	annuity	payments
compounded	annually.
N	=	The	number	of	annuity	payments.

N=	15;	I/Y=	4;	PMT=$29,000,000;	FV	=	0;	CPT	=>	PV	=$322,433,235.50
A	is	incorrect
.	The	amount	represents	the	future	value	of	a	lump	sum	with	annual	compounding
as	follows;
C	is	incorrect

Q.37	
Consider	an	annuity	due	with	20	payments	of	$55,000	every	year	with	a	required	rate	of
interest	of	10%	compounded	annually.	The	present	value	of	the	annuity	if	the	first	payment	is	due
at	the	end	of	the	year	is	
closest	to
:
The	correct	answer	is	
B.
	
Hence	the	present	value	of	an	ordinary	annuity	is	expressed	as	the	sum	of	the	present	values	of
each	annuity	payment,	as	follows;
Where;
A	=	The	annuity	amount.
r	=	The	interest	rate	per	period	corresponding	to	the	frequency	of	annuity	payments.
N	=	The	number	of	annuity	payments.
Therefore;
A	is	incorrect.
	The	amount	represents	the	projected	future	value	of	a	lump	sum	with	no	interim
Cash	as	follows;
C	is	incorrect.
	The	amount	represents	the	future	value	of	the	annuity	payment,	assuming	an
annuity	in	advance	and	not	an	ordinary	annuity	as	required	by	the	question	as	follows;

Q.38	
ABC	Company	Ltd	has	been	in	operation	since	1966.	In	2012	the	company	recorded
revenue	of	$15.8	million	compared	to	$11.4million	in	2006.	The	revenue	growth	rate	for	the
company	for	the	six	years	is	
closest	to
:
The	correct	answer	is	
B.

mortgage	with	monthly	payments,	and	the	first	payment	is	due	in	exactly	one	month.	Mr.	Smith's
monthly	payment	if	the	interest	rate	is	7%	compounded	monthly	is	
closest	to
:
The	correct	answer	is	
A.
	
The	question	requires	the	calculation	of	the	size	of	payments	on	a	Fixed-Rate	Mortgage	and	ABC
Bank	will	define	the	mortgage	payments	such	that	at	the	specified	periodic	interest	rate,	the

The	amount	borrowed	by	Mr.	Smith	of	$150,000	is	equivalent	to	approximately	129	monthly
payments	of	$1,163.56	with	a	stated	interest	rate	of	7%.
Using	the	BA	II	Plus	Pro	Calculator;

Step	I
:	Determine	the	present	value	of	the	perpetuity	at

Q.43	
You	are	presented	with	2	investment	opportunities	and	must	choose	the	one	with	the
greater	present	value:	A	lump-sum	of	$2.5	million	or	an	annuity	with	25	payments	of	$250,000	a
year	with	the	first	payment	starting	today.	The	interest	rate	is	9%	per	year	compounded	annually.
Which	one	will	you	choose?
The	correct	answer	is	
A.
	
The	question	requires	the	calculation	of	an	annuity	due	as	the	present	value	of	an	immediate
cash	flow	plus	an	ordinary	annuity	and	comparing	the	outcome	with	the	lump	sum	payment	as
follows;
Step	I
:	Compare	the	present	value	of	each	investment	option	at	time	
	and	select	the	one
with	the	larger	value.	For	example,	the	first	option's	present	value	is	$2	million	in	this	scenario,
already	stated	in	today's	dollars,	while	the	second	option	is	an	annuity	due.
Step	II
:	Since	the	first	payment	for	the	annuity	due	occurs	at	
,	we	need	to	isolate	the
annuity	benefits	into	two	portions:	an	immediate	$250,000	to	be	paid	today	(
)	and	an
ordinary	annuity	of	$250,000	per	year	for	24	years.
Therefore;
Where:
A	=	Ordinary	annuity	payments.
r	=	Applicable	rate	of	interest.
N	=	Number	of	payments.
Hence;
Using	the	BA	II	Plus	Pro	Calculator	as	follows;
N	=	24
A.	
Annuity	option.
B.	
Lump-sum.
C.	
Invest	in	both	options	since	there's	no	difference	between	the	two.

Q.52	
Consider	an	investor	who	wants	to	double	his	£1,500,000	worth	of	investments.	If	the
interest	rate	is	9%	compounded	annually,	the	time	it	will	take	for	the	value	of	the	investment	to
double	is	
closest	to
:
The	correct	answer	is	
B.
	
The	question	requires	the	calculation	of	the	number	of	annual	compounding	periods	required	for
an	investment	to	reach	a	specific	value	as	follows;
Where;
	=	The	future	value	of	the	investment	amount.
	=	The	present	value	of	the	investment	amount.
	=	Interest	rate	compounded	annually.
	=	Required	number	of	periods	for	the	investment	to	double.
Therefore;
Note	that	you	can	solve	this	question	easily	using	a	financial	calculator	by	letting	I\Y=9,
PV=-1,500,000,	PMT=0	and	FV	=3,000,000	then	hit	the	CBT	button	followed	by	N.	You	will	get
N	=	8.0432	(4	sf).
A	is	incorrect
.	As	per	the	calculation	in	A	above,	it's	practical	that	the	investment	will	only
double	in	8	years.
C	is	incorrect
.	The	number	of	years	indicated	only	applies	if	the	amount	of	investment	is	tripled,
but	rather	the	question	specifically	required	the	investment	to	double.

The	correct	answer	is	
A.
	
The	question	requires	the	calculation	of	the	size	of	payments	on	a	Fixed-Rate	Mortgage,	and	it's
important	to	note	that	the	mortgage	lender	will	determine	the	mortgage	payments	such	that	at
the	stated	periodic	interest	rate,	the	present	value	of	the	payments	will	be	equal	to	the	amount
borrowed	(in	this	case,	$130,000).
To	solve	for	the	annuity	amount,	A,	as	the	present	value	divided	by	the	present	value	annuity
factor	as	follows;
Where;
PV=	Present	value	of	the	mortgage.
rs	=	Annual	interest	rate.
m	=	Monthly	compounding	periods	
N	=	Amount	of	mortgage	repayment	period	
Therefore;
And;
We	could	also	use	the	financial	calculator:
N	=	300;	I/Y	=	6/12	=	0.5;	PV	=	-130,000;	FV	=	0;	CPT	->	PMT	=	837.59
In	conclusion,	the	amount	borrowed,	$130,000,	is	equivalent	to	155	monthly	payments	of
$837.59	with	a	stated	interest	rate	of	6%.
B	is	incorrect.
	It	represents	the	monthly	payment	that	would	have	been	made	if	the	payments
were	to	be	expected	at	the	beginning	(annuity	in	advance)	and	not	at	the	end	of	the	year

manager,	which	involves	making	an	annual	investment	of	$1,000	at	the	end	of	each	year	for	a
duration	of	10	years.	Assuming	the	investment	yields	an	annual	return	of	10%,	
the	amount	that
Smith	can	expect	to	receive	at	the	end	of	the	10th	year	is	
closest	to:
The	correct	answer	is	
B.
	
The	investment	pattern	above	is	similar	to	an	ordinary	annuity.	In	an	ordinary	annuity,	the	cash
flows	occur	at	the	end	of	the	compounding	period.	Therefore,	we	can	consider	this	problem	as
involving	ordinary	annuity.
To	understand	the	principle	behind	the	question,	let’s	construct	the	cash	flow	pattern	of	the
investment.
The	above	illustration	shows	the	main	basis	of	the	calculation.	However,	it	can	also	be	calculated
by	using	the	calculator	as:
N=10;	I/Y=10;	PMT=	-1,000;	PV=0
CPT	⇒	FV	=	15,937.42
A	is	incorrect
.	It	is	simply	the	amount	after	ten	years,	excluding	the	interest	earned	on	the
amount.
C	is	incorrect
.	It	is	the	future	value	of	an	annuity	in	advance,	yet	this	is	an	ordinary	annuity.	To
arrive	at	this	answer	using	a	financial	calculator,	set	the	calculator	to	BGN	mode	and	proceed	as
above.	i.e.,	N=10;	I/Y=10;	PMT=	-1,000;	PV=0	CPT	⇒	FV=17,531.17

Q.3406	
An	investor	wants	to	invest	$1,000	at	the	beginning	of	each	year	for	the	next	10	years,
after	which	he	can	redeem	his	investment	at	the	beginning	of	the	10
th
	year.	The	amount	received
by	the	investor	at	the	end	of	the	10
th
	year,	if	the	investment	generates	a	yearly	return	of	10%,	is
closest
	to:
The	correct	answer	is	
C.
	
We	can	first	calculate	the	ordinary	annuity	using	the	financial	calculator	as:
N=10;	I/Y=10;	PMT=	-1,000;	PV=0
CPT	⇒	FV	=	$15,937.42
To	calculate	annuity	due	directly	using	the	financial	calculator:	First,	set	the	calculator	to	BGN
mode.	This	is	done	by	pressing	2ND	PMT,	then	2ND	ENTER,	then	2ND	CPT.	Then	input	values:
PMT=1,000;	N=10;	1/Y=10;	CPT=>FV=17,531.17
A	is	incorrect
.	It	is	the	future	value	of	a	lump	sum	amount	and	not	an	annuity.
B	is	incorrect
.	It	is	the	future	value	of	an	ordinary	annuity	and	not	that	of	an	annuity	in	advance
as	required	by	the	question.

Q.3407	
Nathan	Lewis	is	planning	to	subscribe	to	an	investment	plan	which	will	generate	a	return
of	5%	and	provide	him	with	$2,000	at	the	end	of	each	year	for	the	next	5	years.	
However,	due	to
financial	constraints,	he	plans	to	subscribe	to	the	investment	plan	in	2	years.	The	present	value
of	the	investment	plan	today	is	
closest
	to:
The	correct	answer	is	
A.
	
The	PV	of	the	ordinary	annuity	after	2	years,	when	Lewis	starts	the	investment	plan,	can	be
calculated	as	under:
N=3;	I/Y=5;	PMT=	-2,000;	FV=0
CPT	⇒	PV=	$5,446.52
However,	this	plan	will	start	in	2	years.	Assuming	the	rate	of	interest	in	these	two	years	is	5%,
the	PV	of	the	annuity	today	can	be	computed	as:
A	is	incorrect
.	It	is	the	present	value	of	the	annuity	at	time	t	=	2	and	not	at	time	t	=	0.
C	is	incorrect
.	It	is	the	present	value	of	an	annuity	in	advance,	not	of	an	ordinary	annuity	as
required	by	the	question,	at	time	
.

If	the	company	intends	to	generate	a	return	of	10%,	then	the	present	value	of	the	projected	cash
flows	today	is	
closest
	to:
The	correct	answer	is	
C.
	
The	cash	flows	and	the	corresponding	details	are	as	given	below:
We	can	also	use	the	CF	button	of	the	BA	II	Plus	Pro	calculator	to	determine	the	present	value	of
the	cash	flow.
CF0=0↓,	CF1	=	100,000	ENTER↓↓;	CF2=	600,000	ENTER
Then	press	"CPT	NPV"	after	inputting	all	CFs,	then	input	I/Y=10	ENTER↓,	press	the	"down

The	correct	answer	is	
A.
	
The	payments	required	to	be	made	so	that	the	loan	is	completely	paid	off	in	three	years	can	be
calculated	as:
N=3;	I/Y=3;	FV=	0;	PV=5000;

B	is	incorrect.

the	2,000	at	the	end	of	the	first	year.
C	is	incorrect.
	It	is	basically	what	remains	after	paying	the	2,000,	divided	by	2,	without
