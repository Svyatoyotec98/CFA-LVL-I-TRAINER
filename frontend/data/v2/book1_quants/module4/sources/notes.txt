LOS 4a: calculate expected values, variances, and standard deviations
and demonstrate their application to investment problems
Expected Value
Expected value is an essential quantitative concept investors use to estimate investment returns
and analyze any factor that may impact their financial position.
Mathematically, the expected value is the probability-weighted average of the possible outcomes
of the random variable. For a random variable X, the expected value of X is denoted E(X). More
specifically,
E(X)=P(X )X +P(X )X +⋯ +P(X )X

Where,
X= One of n possible outcomes of the discrete random variable X.

) = Probability of X taking the value x.
Note that the expected can be a forecast (looking into the future) or the true value of the
population mean.
The sample mean differs from the expected value. The sample mean is a central value for a
specific set of observations, calculated as an equally weighted average of those observations.

Variance and Standard Deviation
Consider expected value as a forecast of the outcome of an investment. Then, variance and
standard deviation measure the risk of an investment. That is the dispersion of outcomes around
the mean.
The variance of a random variable is the expected value (the probability-weighted average) of
squared deviations from the random variable's expected value. Denoted by σ2(X) or Var(X), its
formula is given by:
Var(X)=E[X−E(X)]2

)[X

i=1
Since variance is in squared terms, it can take any number greater than or equal to
0(Var(X) ≥0). Intuitively, if Var(X) =0, there is no risk (dispersion). On the other hand, if
Var(X) >0, it signifies the dispersion of outcomes.
Moreover, Var(X) is a quantity given in square units of X. That is, if the X is given in percentage,
then Var(X) is given in squared percentage.
The standard deviation is the square root of variance:
110
© 2014-2024 AnalystPrep.σ(X)=√σ2(X) =√Var(X)
The standard deviation is given in the same units as the random variance; hence it is easy to
interpret.

explain the use of conditional expectations in investment application
A tree diagram is a visual representation of all possible future outcomes and the associated
probabilities of a random variable. Tree diagrams are handy when we have several possible
outcomes.
They facilitate the recording of all the possibilities in a clear, uncomplicated manner. Each
branch in a tree diagram represents an outcome.
Example: Probability Tree
Let's consider a scenario where we toss a fair coin twice. The outcomes of these tosses are
independent, meaning the first toss doesn't influence the second one.
For the first toss, we have two possibilities: It can result in either a head or a tail. Similarly, we
still have the same two possibilities for the second toss: head or tail. Importantly, the outcome of
the second toss is not affected by what happened in the first toss because coins don't have
memory.
We can visualize these probabilities using a tree diagram like this:
113
© 2014-2024 AnalystPrep.Please, note the following:
The tree diagram must include all the possible outcomes.
The sum of the probabilities must add up to 1.
The number of branches is the number of different possibilities.
The numbers on the branches present probabilities.
To calculate probabilities, we follow the tree branches from left to right and multiply any
probabilities we encounter.
So, to find the probability of getting two heads (HH), we multiply the probabilities along the
path.

If we sum up the probabilities of all possibilities, we get 1.
Conditional Expectations
In investments, conditional expectation means predicting the expected value of an investment
based on specific real-world events. Analysts consider the probability and impact of future events
when calculating this value.
Competitors, governments, and other financial institutions keep releasing new information. Such
pieces of information may have a positive or a negative impact on investment. This means that a
project's expected value must be based on real-world dynamics.
In statistics, the conditional expected value is the expected value of a random variable X given an
event or scenario S, denoted by E(X∣S).
Now, assume that X can take on any of n different outcomes X ,X ,…,X , which are outcomes

Stating Unconditional Expected Value in Terms of Conditional
Expected Value
To state the unconditional expected values in terms of conditional expected value, we use the
total probability rule for expected value, which is built from the following formula:
E(X) =P(S)⋅E(X∣ S)+P(SC) ⋅E(X∣SC)
Where SC is the complement (event or scenario “S” does not occur) of S.

The probability of relaxed trade restrictions in a given country is 40%. Therefore, shareholders of
XYZ Company Limited expect a 5% share return if trade restrictions are maintained and a loss of
8% if they are relaxed. The expected change in return is closest to:
Solution
We must take every possibility into account. We have a 40% chance of relaxed trade restrictions
in this case. Intuitively, this means there is a 60% chance that the current restrictions will be
maintained. Therefore:

Example: Total Probability Rule for Expected Value
BlueChip Inc.'s profits are sensitive to economic growth, benefitting significantly during periods
of high economic growth. Suppose there is a 0.70 probability that BlueChip Inc. will operate in a
high-growth economic environment in the next fiscal year and a 0.30 probability that it will
operate in a moderate-growth environment. Assume that the chance of a recession is negligible.
If a high-growth economic environment occurs, the probability that EPS will be USD 3.00 is
estimated at 0.40, and the probability that EPS will be USD 2.80 is estimated at 0.60.
On the other hand, if the company operates in a moderate-growth environment, the probabilities
that the EPS will be USD 2.50 and USD 2.25 are 20% and 80%, respectively.
116
© 2014-2024 AnalystPrep.Calculate the expected value of EPS for BlueChip Inc. in the next fiscal year.
Solution
We start by drawing a probability tree:
We first need to calculate the conditional expectations of EPS for each scenario: High-growth
environment and moderate-growth environment. That is,
E(EPS ∣ High-growth environment)=0.40×3.00+0.60×2.80
=USD 2.88
E(EPS ∣Moderate-growth environment)=0.20×2.50+0.80×2.25
=USD 2.30
Using the total probability for the expected value, we have:
117
© 2014-2024 AnalystPrep.E(EPS) =P(High-growth environment)
⋅E(EPS ∣High-growth environment)
+P(High-growth environment)
⋅E(EPS?Moderate-growth environment)

=USD 2.71

There is a 20% chance that the government will impose a tariff on imported cars. A
company that assembles cars locally expects returns of 14% if the tariff is imposed
and returns of 11% otherwise. The (unconditional) expected return is closest to:
A. 11.6%.
B. 12.8%.
C. 12.5%.
Solution
The correct answer is A.
The unconditional expected return will be the sum of:
1. The expected return given no tariff times the probability that a tariff
will not be imposed.
2. The expected return given tariff times the probability that the tariff
will be imposed. Therefore,

© 2014-2024 AnalystPrep.LOS 4c: calculate and interpret an updated probability in an investment
setting using Bayes’ formula
Investors make investment decisions based on their experience and expertise. Their decisions
may change in the wake of new knowledge and observations.
Bayes' formula allows us to update our decisions as we receive new information. In other words,
Bayes' formula is used to calculate an updated or posterior probability given a set of prior
probabilities for a given event.
Given a set of prior probabilities for an event, if we receive new information, the updated
probability is as follows:
Probability of the new information given event
Updated probability of an event given the new information=
Unconditional probability of the new information
×Prior probability of event.
The above equation can be written as:
P(Information ∣ Event)
P(Event∣ Information)= ⋅P(Event)
P(Information)
Deriving Bayes' Formula

calculate P(B ∣A) if given information only about P(A∣B ).

Example: Bayes' Formula
An Investment Analyst wishes to investigate the performance of stocks by considering a number
of stocks listed on different exchanges. In the sample, 50% of stocks were listed on the New York
Stock Exchange (NYSE), 30% on the London Stock Exchange (LSE), and 20% on the Tokyo Stock
Exchange (TSE).
The probability of a stock posting a negative return on the NYSE, LSE, and TSE is 40%, 35%, and
25%, respectively.
If the Analyst picks a stock at random from this group, what is the probability that it has a
negative return on the NYSE?
Solution
We are looking for P(NYSE | Negative Return).
Let’s define the following events:
NYSE is the event “A stock chosen at random is listed on the NYSE.”
122
© 2014-2024 AnalystPrep.LSE is the event “A stock chosen at random is listed on the LSE.”
TSE is the event “A stock chosen at random is listed on the TSE.”
Finally, let NR be the event “A randomly chosen stock posts a negative return.”
Therefore,
P(NYSE)P(NR|NYSE)
P(NYSE|NR) =
P (NYSE)P(NR|NYSE)+P(LSE)P (NR|LSE)+P(TSE)P(NR|TSE)

You have developed a set of criteria for assessing potential investments in growth-
stage companies. Companies not meeting these criteria are predicted to be insolvent
within 24 months. You gathered the following information when validating your
criteria:
Fifty percent of the companies that have been assessed will become
insolvent within 24 months: P(insolvency) =0.50.
Sixty-five percent of the companies assessed meet the criteria:
P(meet criteria)=0.65.
The probability that a company will meet the criteria given that it remains
solvent for 24 months is 0.80: P(meet criteria∣ solvency) =0.80.
The probability that a company will remain solvent, given that it meets the criteria,
that is, P(solvency∣ meet criteria), is closest to:
A. 20%.
B. 50%.
C. 62%.
Solution
Using Bayes' formula, we have:
P(solvency ∣meet criteria)
P(meet criteria ∣solvency)P(solvency)
=
[P(meet criteria ∣solvency)P(solvency)
+P(meet criteria∣ insolvency)P(insolvency)]
0.80×0.50
=
0.80×0.50+P(meet criteria ∣ insolvency)×0.50
Clearly, we need to calculate the P(meet criteria ∣insolvency). Using the total
probability:
124
© 2014-2024 AnalystPrep.P(meet criteria)=P(meet criteria ∣solvency)P(solvency)
+P(meet criteria ∣insolvency)P(insolvency)
⇒0.65=0.80×0.50+P(meet criteria ∣ insolvency)×0.50
0.65−0.80×0.50
∴P(meet criteria∣ insolvency) = =0.50
0.50
As such,
0.80×0.50
P(solvency ∣meet criteria) = =0.6153 ≈62%
