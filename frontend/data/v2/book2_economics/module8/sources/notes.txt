Learning Module 8: Exchange Rate Calculations
LOS 8a: calculate and interpret currency cross-rates
It is possible to back out the cross rates given two exchange rates involving three currencies.
Consider a foreign exchange market with the exchange rate between the South African rand and
the Chinese yuan. This market can also quote the exchange rate between the South African rand
and the Russian ruble (RUB). It is, therefore, possible to back out the cross-rates between the
Chinese yuan and the Russian ruble, which is quoted as (RUB/CNY) according to market
conventions and can be represented as follows:
RUB ZAR RUB
× =
ZAR CNY CNY
For example, the RUB/ZAR exchange rate is 1.4876, and the ZAR/CNY exchange rate is 1.6459.
We can calculate the RUB/CNY exchange rate using sample spot exchange rates as follows:
RUB ZAR
× =1.4876 ×1.6459 =2.4484 Russian Rubble per Chinese Yuan
ZAR CNY
Inversion
Sometimes, it is important to invert one of the quotes to get the intermediary currency to cancel
out the equation and get the cross rate. For example, to get the Russian ruble–Japanese yen
(JPY/RUB) quote, we first invert the South African rand–Russia ruble (RUB/ZAR) quote before
multiplying it by the South African rand–Japanese yen (JPY/ZAR).
Example: Currency Cross-Rates
Let's assume we have spot exchange rates of RUB/ZAR =1.4876 and JPY/ZAR = 70.74. The
South African rand–Russia ruble (RUB/ZAR) ruble exchange rate of 1.4876 inverts to:
RUB −1 ZAR 1
( ) =( ) = =0.6722
ZAR RUB 1.4876
183

ZAR JPY
( )×( ) =0.6722 × 70.74 = 47.5531 JPY per RUB
RUB ZAR
Triangular Arbitrage in Cross Rate Calculations
Market participants can access both cross-rate quotes (e.g., JPY/CAD for Japan yen–Canada) and
the underlying component exchange rate quotes (e.g., CAD/USD for dollar–Canada and JPY/USD
for dollar–yen). These cross rates must align with their respective calculations; if not, traders will
exploit the discrepancy through arbitrage. This type of profit-seeking, termed triangular
arbitrage (given its involvement with three currencies), would persist until the price imbalance
is corrected.
Example: Illustrating Triangular Arbitrage
To illustrate, consider a JPY/CAD rate derived at 85.98 based on the underlying CAD/USD and
JPY/USD rates of 1.3020 and 111.94, respectively:
−1
JPY CAD JPY
=( ) ×( )= (1.3020)−1×111.94 =85.98
CAD USD USD
If a misinformed dealer simultaneously offers a JPY/CAD rate of 86.20, it presents a different
price for the same service, which, in this case, is converting yen to Canadian dollars. A savvy
trader could purchase CAD1 for JPY85.98 and immediately sell it for JPY86.20, making a risk-free
profit of JPY0.22 per CAD1.
In practice, such discrepancies in cross-rates are infrequent. Both human traders and automated
trading algorithms vigilantly monitor the markets for any pricing inefficiencies, ensuring swift
corrections.

© 2014-2024 AnalystPrep.LOS 8b: explain the arbitrage relationship between spot and forward
exchange rates and interest rates, calculate a forward rate using points
or in percentage terms, and interpret a forward discount or premium
This section will consider the relationships between spot and forward rates, interest rates, and
maturities based on market efficiencies.
Spot and Forward Rates
In the professional FX market, forward exchange rates are commonly quoted in terms of 'points'
or 'pips.' These points represent the difference between the forward and spot exchange rate
quotes. The scale is adjusted so that these points correspond to the last decimal place in the spot
quote.
If the forward rate is higher than the spot rate, the points are positive, indicating that the base
currency trades at a forward premium. On the other hand, when the forward rate is below the
spot rate, the points are negative, suggesting the base currency trades at a forward discount.
Notably, when the base currency is at a forward premium, the price currency will be at a forward
discount, and vice versa.
To understand this argument, let's look at a scenario in 2023. The spot USD/CAD exchange rate
was 1.3845, and the six-month forward rate was 1.38475. This suggests that the CAD (base
currency) was trading at a premium compared to the spot rate. The six-month forward points
were quoted as 2.5, and this can be calculated as follows:
1.38475−1.3845 =0.00025
We multiply by 10,000 to reach the desired result. This scaling ensures the points align with the
final digit of the spot exchange rate quote, which is usually the fourth decimal place.
Additionally, it's noteworthy that while points are usually quoted to at least one decimal place,
the forward rate might extend to five or even more decimal places.
Among major currencies, the yen stands as an exception. Its spot rates are typically quoted to
just two decimal places. Therefore, the difference between its forward and spot rates is
186
© 2014-2024 AnalystPrep.multiplied by 100 to adjust for its two-decimal-place precision.
Forward Points and Maturity
Forward rate quotes are typically presented as the number of forward points for each specific
maturity, which refers to the time interval between the spot settlement and the forward contract
settlement. Often, these forward points are also termed 'swap points' since an FX swap
encompasses both a spot and a forward transaction executed simultaneously.
To convert forward quotations into an outright forward quotation, let's use an example with the
RUB/CNY currency pair. We'll use a table that shows maturity and forward or spot rate points.
Maturity Spot rate or forward points
Spot 1.6459
One week −0.2
One month −0.1
Three months −5.6
Six months −12.7
Twelve-month −25.3
From the table above, notice that the absolute number of points increases with maturity. This
trend emerges because the number of points is directly proportional to the yield differential
between the two involved countries (in this case, Russia and China). This differential is then
adjusted based on the term to maturity.
As the term to maturity extends, the absolute number of forward points increases. In the same
vein, for a fixed term to maturity, a greater interest rate differential results in a higher absolute
number of forward points.
Calculating Forward Exchange Rates
To calculate forward exchange rates using forward points, you divide the points by 10,000. This
scales down the fourth decimal place found in the spot rate. Then, you add the result to the spot
exchange rate quote.
We can take the case of the six-month forward rate in the above table. Here we have:
−12.7
187
© 2014-2024 AnalystPrep.−12.7
1.6459+ = 1.6459−0.00127= 1.64463
10000
Often, the forward rate points are represented as a percentage of the spot and not as an absolute
number of points. As such, the six-month forward rate for RUB/CNY can be shown as follows:
1.6459−0.00127
−1=−0.077%
1.6459
To convert this percentage into a forward rate, we simply need to multiply the spot rate by one
plus the percentage forward premium or discount:
1.6459×(1+(−0.00077)) =1.6459×0.99923=1.64463
Arbitrage Relationships between Spot and Forward Rates
To understand the arbitrage relations between spot and forward exchange rates, we need to
consider interactions between spot rates, forward rates, and interest rates.
Note that forward exchange rates are derived from an arbitrage principle that ensures equal
investment returns on two alternative yet equivalent investment opportunities.
Using a single-period analogy, an investor who has funds to invest in treasury securities has two
alternatives:
1. Invest at the domestic risk-free rate (r ).
d
2. Invest at the foreign risk-free rate (r).
f
Option i:
If the investor takes the first option, the fund held at the end of the period would be (1+i ).
d
Option ii:
Alternatively, the investor could convert the domestic currency to be invested in a foreign
188
© 2014-2024 AnalystPrep.currency using the spot rate S . It is important to note that (f/d) is the currency quoting
f/d
convention that expresses the number of foreign units per single domestic unit.
At the end of the investment period, S (1+r ) units of foreign currency would be held by the
f/d f
investor. Then, the funds would have to be converted back into the domestic currency using the
initial (pre-agreed) forward rate.
Note that the two investment alternatives are risk-free because they are invested in risk-free
assets.
Since these investment alternatives are equal by considering the risk characteristics, the returns
must also be equal. As such, we have the following relationship:
1
1+r =S (1+r )( )
d f/d f
F
f/d
This formula above outlines two alternative investments (represented on either side of an
equation) expected to yield equal returns. Should the returns differ, a risk-free arbitrage
opportunity arises. An investor can capitalize on this by short-selling the lower-yield investment
and directing those funds into the higher-yield one.
Note that is the number of units of domestic currency for each unit of foreign sold forward. The
relationship above can be rearranged to get the formula for a forward rate as illustrated below:
1+r

F = S ( )
f/d f/d

Where:
S = Current spot exchange rate.

Given that the spot exchange S is 1.502, the domestic risk-free rate for 12 months is 4%, and

the 12-month foreign risk-free rate is 6.2%, the forward rate F is:

f/d f/d 1+r

Forward Rate as a Percentage of the Spot Rate
We can rearrange the no-arbitrage equation between the spot and exchange rates as follows:
F 1+r
f/d f
=
S 1+r
f/d d
Intuitively, from the above equation, under an f/d quoting convention, if foreign interest rates
exceed domestic rates, the forward rate will be priced at a premium relative to the spot rate.
Generally speaking, without considering the quoting convention, the currency with the higher
(lower) interest rate will always trade at a discount (premium) in the forward market.
We can interpret the forward exchange rate as the expected future spot rates. If we let F =F ,
t f/d
S =S and finally F =S then the above equation can be written as:
t f/d t t+1
S t+1
=
1+r f
S 1+r
t d
⇒%ΔS = S t+1 −1=( r f −r d )
t+1 S 1+r
t d
As such, if we interpret forward rates as expected future spot rates, the expected percentage
change in the spot rate is proportional to the interest rate differential (r −r ).
f d
Interpreting forward rates are interpreted as expected future spot rates have some setbacks. For
instance, the relationship between spot and forward exchange rates is influenced by any factor
affecting the yield curve in either the domestic or foreign market. Consequently, FX markets are
190
© 2014-2024 AnalystPrep.interconnected with global events, reflecting influences from other global markets.
As such, in real-world trading, currency traders and strategists do not rely solely on forward
rates for their currency expectations or strategies.
However, it is useful to understand forward exchange rates simply as a product of the arbitrage
equation and forward points as being related to the interest rate differential between the two
countries.
Forward Discount Premiums based on Spot and Interest Rates
Recall that a forward discount is when the domestic current spot exchange rate is traded at a
higher level than the current domestic future spot rates. On the other hand, A forward premium
is a situation when the forward exchange rate is higher than the spot exchange rate. Conversely,
a forward discount is when the forward exchange rate is lower than the spot exchange rate.
The analysis of the expectations from the market depends mostly on discounts and premiums.
Also, they enable one to know the currencies that should appreciate and those that will
depreciate in the near future.
Calculation
Recall the arbitrage formula:
1+i

F = S ( )

S = Current spot exchange rate.

191
© 2014-2024 AnalystPrep.Note that in the above formula, we assumed a single-period analogy. Suppose the investment
term is a fraction, τ, of the period for which the interest rates are quoted. Consequently, the
interest earned in the domestic and foreign markets would be r τ and r τ respectively.
d f
As such, the arbitrage formula transforms into:
1+r τ
f
F = S ( )
f/d f/d
1+r τ
d
Intuitively, if we wish to calculate the forward premium or discount, we find the difference
between the forward and spot exchange rates:
1+r τ

F −S =S ( )−S

Therefore, forward points, when appropriately scaled, are proportional to the spot exchange rate
and the interest rate differential. They are approximately, but not exactly, proportional to the
horizon of the forward contract.
The common day count (for example, LIBOR deposits) is actual/360. Consider the following
example.
Example: Forward Discount or Premium
Let's say we have a 31-day forward exchange rate. The domestic 31-day risk-free interest rate is
2.5% per year, and the foreign 31-day risk-free interest rate is 3.5%. The spot exchange rate is
1.5630. We can calculate the forward premium or discount using two methods:
Method 1:
We first calculate the forward exchange rate, and then we subtract the spot exchange rate from

Hence, the forward trading premium is:
F − S =1.56434−1.5630 =0.00134
f/d f/d
Since forward premiums or discounts are usually quoted in pips or points, multiplying the result
by 10,000 will give us 0.00134×10,000=13.4 pips, which is the forward trading premium
quoted in pips or points.

© 2014-2024 AnalystPrep.Question #1
An Italian company has secured a contract with a US client, expecting a payment of
USD 40 million in 45 days. The finance manager of the Italian firm wishes to hedge
the FX risk of this deal and gets the following rates from a broker:
USD/EUR spot rate: 0.9220
One-month forward points: +2.0
According to the exchange rate information provided, the finance manager could
hedge the FX risk by:
1. Buying euro (selling US dollars) at a forward rate of 0.9222.
2. Buying euro (selling US dollars) at a forward rate of 0.9200.
3. Selling euro (buying US dollars) at a forward rate of 0.9200.
Solution
The correct answer is A.
The Italian company would aim to change the US dollar to its home currency, the
euro (it intends to sell US dollars and buy euros), using a forward rate calculated as
0.9220 + (+2.0/10,000) = 0.9222.
By doing this, the company is able to protect itself against any unfavorable
movements in the foreign exchange rate over the next 45 days (before payment is
received). In other words, the company wants locks in the exchange rate of USD/EUR
= 0.9222 now. This can be achieved using a forward contract, which allows the
company to exchange currencies at a predetermined rate in the future.
Question #2
When is a foreign currency most likely trading at a forward premium?
194
© 2014-2024 AnalystPrep.1. When the forward rate expressed in the domestic currency is below the spot
rate.
2. When the forward rate expressed in the domestic currency is above the spot
rate.
3. When the forward rate expressed in the foreign/domestic currency is at
equilibrium.
Solution
The correct answer is B.
A foreign currency is at a forward premium if the forward rate expressed in domestic
currency is above the spot rate.
