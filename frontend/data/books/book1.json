Arithmetic return = = 1.5% (6% + 2.5% −3% + 8% −6%) 5 Geometric mean = (1.06 × 1.025 × 0.97 × 1.08 × 0.94)1/5 −1 = 1.36% © 2014-2024 AnalystPrep. 31"

III © 2014-2024 AnalystPrep. 261 As always, the first step involves formulating a relevant hypothesis. We are concerned that the earnings of the insurance company could be greater (more variant) than those of the banking industry. Therefore, the appropriate hypothesis is: H0: s1 2 s 2 2 and H1: s 1 2 > s 2 2 Where s 1 2 is the variance of earnings for the insurance industry, and s 2 2 is the corresponding variance for the banking industry. Next in line is the selection of the test statistic. When comparing the variances of two different populations, we use the F-statistic, computed as: F = (S1 2/S2 2) where S1 2 and S2 2 are the sample variances The F-statistic has (n1 - 1, n2 - 2) degrees of freedom. i.e. F30,40 F = 4.82/4.32 = 1.2461 Note that this is a one-sided test. As such, our critical value should be the upper 5% point of the F-distribution with (30, 40) degrees of freedom. This value = 1.74 Since 1.2461 is less than 1.74, it lies in the non-rejection, and therefore, we have insufficient evidence to reject H0 at the 5% level of significance.

            "A": "A higher F-statistic is indicative of a statistically significant relationship between the dependent and independent variables in the model. The F-statistic tests the null hypothesis that all regression coefficients are equal to zero, meaning no relationship exists between the dependent and independent variables. A higher F-statistic value leads to the rejection of this null hypothesis, suggesting that the model has at least one significant predictor variable. Therefore, a model with a higher F-statistic is generally considered to provide a better representation of the relationship between variables.",
            "C": "The standard error of estimate ( ) measures the average distance that the observed values fall from the regression line. A lower indicates that the model has a tighter fit to the observed data, as the observed values are closer to the predicted values. This implies that the model with a lower would more accurately represent the relationship between auto sales and bank financing rates, as it suggests less dispersion of the observed values around the fitted values. Therefore, a model with a lower is preferable for accurately representing the relationship between variables. CFA Level I, Quantitative Methods, Learning Module 10: Simple Linear Regression.

The availability of new datasets previously unavailable, such as sensor data from satellites, online activity of individuals, and the internet of things. 2.

            "A": "While the exponential increase in the amount of data available has indeed played a crucial role in the big data revolution, attributing the revolution solely to this factor overlooks the equally important contributions of advancements in computing power and data storage capacity. The availability of large datasets, such as sensor data from satellites, online activity logs, and the Internet of Things (IoT) devices, has certainly fueled the growth of big data. However, without the corresponding advancements in technology to process and store this data efficiently, the potential of these vast datasets could not have been fully realized.",
            "B": "Similarly, attributing the big data revolution solely to the increase in computing power and data storage capacity, at affordable costs, does not provide a complete picture. While these technological advancements have been pivotal in enabling the processing and analysis of large datasets, the revolution also owes much to the exponential growth in the volume of data generated. This includes data from diverse sources such as social media, e-commerce, digital communications, and IoT devices. The synergy between the increased data availability and the technological capabilities to handle such data has been fundamental to the big data revolution.

Efficiency in this context refers to the speed and accuracy with which trades are executed, minimizing slippage and operational costs. Although these are important factors, the core driver for the adoption of algorithmic trading is its ability to navigate and exploit opportunities across multiple market destinations, rather than efficiency alone.",
            "C": "The ability to execute large trades is indeed a feature of algorithmic trading, particularly through techniques such as order slicing, which breaks down large orders into smaller, less market-disruptive transactions. However, this capability, while valuable, is not the primary reason for the increased adoption of algorithmic trading. The fragmentation of financial markets and the subsequent need to efficiently access and trade across these diverse venues are more significant factors driving the adoption of algorithmic trading strategies.
