A correlation of zero means there is no linear relationship between two variables. A correlation of -1 means the two variables are perfectly negatively correlated, which implies that when one variable increases, the other variable decreases proportionally. However, a correlation of 3 is not possible since the correlation coefficient ranges from -1 to 1.",

Among these portfolios, the global minimum variance portfolio is unique because it is the one that minimizes risk across all possible portfolios, not just those on the efficient frontier. This makes it an important concept in portfolio management and asset allocation, as it provides a benchmark for the lowest risk that can be achieved through diversification under the assumptions of modern portfolio theory.",

On the other hand, Stock B provides a 7% return with a 6% standard deviation, signifying a higher level of risk but also a greater potential return.

This is primarily due to the nature of small-cap companies, which are smaller in market capitalization. These companies often operate in niche markets or are in the early stages of development, making them more susceptible to market volatility and economic changes. However, this also means they have a higher potential for growth compared to larger, more established companies. Historically, small-cap stocks have shown higher returns over the long term, albeit with higher volatility and risk. This higher risk and return profile is attributed to the fact that small-cap companies can rapidly grow in value, but they can also face significant challenges that can adversely affect their stock prices.",

His lack of financial knowledge depicts a lower willingness to take risk. A 24-years old finance graduate only has high knowledge and willingness to take risk but his ability is limited as he does not have a stable income.

This type of risk is crucial for investors, creditors, and other stakeholders as it directly impacts an organization's long-term viability and its ability to sustain operations over time. Solvency risk is concerned with an entity's overall financial health, specifically its ability to generate enough cash flow to meet both its short-term and long-term obligations, including paying off long-term debts, interest, and other fixed charges. An organization that is unable to manage its solvency risk effectively may face bankruptcy or liquidation in the long term. Therefore, assessing solvency risk involves evaluating the entity's capital structure, leverage ratios, and the sustainability of its business model.",
