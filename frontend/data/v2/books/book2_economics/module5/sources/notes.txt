Learning Module 5: Introduction to Geopolitics
LOS 5b: describe geopolitics and its relationship with globalization
Globalization is the interaction and integration of individuals, organizations, and governments on
a global scale. It is characterized by the cross-border movement of goods, information,
employment, and culture.
Globalization allows businesses to find the most optimal inputs for their products, whether in
relation to quality or cost-efficiency. Moreover, globalization paves the way for global investors to
engage in various aspects like engineering, production, supply chain management, and logistics.
Features of Globalization
Recall that political cooperation and non-cooperation serve as a perspective to evaluate
geopolitical entities, mainly those at the national or state level. However, globalization emerges
primarily from economic and financial collaborations, driven predominantly by non-state actors
like corporations, individuals, and organizations.
Globalization is characterized by economic and financial cooperation, such as active trade of
goods and services, capital flows, currency exchange, and cultural and information exchange.
Actors involved in globalization are inclined to look outside their country for access to new
markets, talent, or education.
Anti-globalization or nationalism is the promotion of a country's economic interests at the
expense of or in opposition to those of other nations. Nationalism is characterized by limited
economic and financial collaboration. Actors under this umbrella tend to prioritize domestic
production and sales, minimize cross-border investments and capital movements, and limit
foreign currency transactions.
Collaboration and globalization frequently go hand in hand (correlated). This means that political
cooperation can promote or hasten globalization. Nonetheless, globalization also occurs in
isolation.
113
© 2014-2024 AnalystPrep.Motivations for Globalization
Three potential gains from participating in globalization are:
i. Increasing profits: There are two ways in which this can happen:
Increasing sales: This can be done by selling one's products or services in
new geographical regions.
Reducing costs: This can be done by sourcing cheaper inputs from different
countries.
ii. Access to resources and markets: Companies looking for long-term access to
resources such as people or raw materials may need to work together. They eventually
end up globalizing to have access to these resources.
iii. Intrinsic gain: An activity's intrinsic gain is a byproduct or consequence that results in
a benefit that overlaps profit. Accelerated productivity as a result of learning new
techniques is a good example.
Costs of Globalization
Potential disadvantages of globalization include:
Unequal Accrual of Economic and Financial Gains
Jobs are created in a foreign country if a company moves a manufacturing plant to that country.
Consequently, this may occasion job losses in the home country. In addition, the foreign country's
businesses may have to compete with the corporation for workers and resources.
Lower Environmental, Social, and Governance Standards
Companies that operate in low-cost nations frequently adhere to the local regulations in those
nations. Globalization can deplete human, administrative, and environmental resources if
114
© 2014-2024 AnalystPrep.standards are lower in one country than in another. Under such circumstances, businesses
ultimately lower their production standards.
Political Consequences
Globalization can lead to income and wealth inequality, as some countries gain jobs while others
lose them due to businesses moving abroad. This inequality can reduce political and economic
cooperation.
Interdependence
Increased economic and financial cooperation could make businesses more reliant on foreign
resources for their supply chains. This, in turn, could make countries more reliant on foreign
countries for certain resources.
Threats of Rollback of Globalizations
There has been an international threat of deglobalization since 2008, when America started a
series of “America First” initiatives. These policies have their roots in nationalism, isolationism,
and worries for the security of the country and the economy. Multinational firms are reluctant to
alter their procedures in the face of immediate conflicts brought about by these policies that
might be settled in the long run.
Even with the ongoing discussions about deglobalization, it seems implausible to completely
undo globalization. The following techniques are employed by these businesses to strengthen
their supply chains:
i. Reshoring Essentials: Encompasses the creation of local supply chains for vital goods
to address emergencies effectively.
ii. Reglobalizing Production: Involves replicating and bolstering supply chains to ensure
greater robustness in production networks.
iii. Doubling down on Key Markets: Involves expanding production in countries with
115
© 2014-2024 AnalystPrep.significant market presence while concurrently integrating external supply chains.
116
© 2014-2024 AnalystPrep.Question
Which of the following is least likely a motivation for globalization by non-state
actors?
A. Intrinsic gain.
B. Currency exchange.
C. Access to resources and markets.
The correct answer is B.
Currency exchange is a characteristic of globalization but not necessarily a
motivation for globalization by non-state actors.
A is incorrect. Intrinsic gain is a motivation for globalization by non-state actors. It
is a side effect of an activity that generates a benefit beyond the profit itself. An
example of an intrinsic gain is accelerated productivity that stems from learning new
methods. Other motivations include increasing profits and access to resources and
markets.
C is incorrect. Access to resources and markets such as talent and raw materials is
a motivation for globalization by non-actors. Non-actors may also globalize to access
market and investment opportunities.
117
© 2014-2024 AnalystPrep.LOS 5c: describe functions and objectives of the international
organizations that facilitate trade, including the World Bank, the
International Monetary Fund, and the World Trade Organization
The global trade decline in the 1940s had some negative impacts. The living standards of people
fell, and unemployment became a chronic issue. Because of this, there was a need to create
international organizations to oversee economic relationships among countries.
As a result of the July 1944 conference, two main multinational organizations emerged: the
World Bank and the International Monetary Fund (IMF). Later, the International Trade
Organization was formed to handle the trade side of the international economic organization.
International Monetary Fund
The IMF lends foreign currencies to its members to aid them during periods of crisis or
important external deficits. The pool of gold and currencies contributed by members enabled this
operation to succeed. The IMF's main job is to maintain the stability of the international
monetary system. This system allows countries to trade goods and services by managing
exchange rates and international payments.
Other objectives include:
Acts as a platform for discussing international monetary issues.
Encourages the expansion of global trade and champions job creation, economic
development, and the reduction of poverty.
Advocates for stable exchange rates and a transparent international payment system.
Offers foreign currency loans to its members on a short-term basis with appropriate
protections, assisting them in managing balance of payments challenges.
The IMF has expanded and redefined its operations since the global financial crisis of 2008 by:
Strengthening lending facilities: The IMF has increased member nations' access to
118
© 2014-2024 AnalystPrep.funding resources and simplified its lending approach to mitigate the negative
perception of borrowing for countries seeking financial assistance.
Enhancing global, regional, and country economic monitoring: The IMF has
refined its oversight of worldwide, regional, and national economies, enhancing its
ability to guide member states.
Addressing Global Economic Disparities: The IMF facilitates discussions among
nations using a shared framework to tackle global economic imbalances.
Evaluating Capital Market Trends: The IMF has allocated more resources to
scrutinizing global financial markets and delivers training to national officials on
effective financial system management.
Identifying Financial Sector Weaknesses: Through its assessment program, the
IMF alerts countries to vulnerabilities and potential risks in their financial sectors.
The World Trade Organization
The World Trade Organization is unique because it's the only organization regulating cross-
border trade relationships globally. Consequently, it replaced the General Agreement on Tariffs
and Trade (GATT ) of January 1995. However, the GATT still exists in the form of its 1994
version.
The functions of WTO include:
Administrate, implement and operate individual agreements, solve disputes, and act as
a platform for negotiations.
Ensure transparency of trade policies by supervising global policy settings.
Provide training and cooperation to low-income, least-developed countries. As a result,
this helps them adjust to the rules of the WTO.
Act as a source of economic analysis and research.
119
© 2014-2024 AnalystPrep.World Bank Group
World Bank Group's main objective is to enhance a good environment for normal economic
growth and help developing countries curb poverty.
For growth and business appeal in developing nations, it's essential to:
Enhance governmental structures and train their officials.
Establish legal and judicial frameworks that are conducive to business.
Safeguard personal and property rights and uphold contractual agreements.
Build strong financial infrastructures to cater to needs from micro-loans to substantial
corporate financing.
Address and mitigate corruption.
Given the above requirements, the objectives of the World Bank Group include:
Provide funds for projects in developing countries and financial and technical expertise
aimed at helping those countries fight poverty.
Ensure the capabilities of its partners, people in developing countries, and its own
staff.
Provision of analysis, advice, and information to its member countries to enable them
to achieve the Lasting economic and social improvements their people need.
Help create economic infrastructures to set up domestic financial markets and a well-
functioning financial industry in developing countries.
120

Among these trade organizations, which one regulates cross-border trade
relationship.
across the globe?
A. World Bank Group.
B. World Trade Organization.
C. International Monetary Fund.
Solution
The correct answer is B.
The World Trade Organization is the only organization that is in charge of cross-
border trade.
121
© 2014-2024 AnalystPrep.LOS 5d: describe geopolitical risk
Geopolitical risk is the risk posed by tensions or acts between parties that impact the regular and
peaceful development of international relations. When the geographic and political elements
influencing country relations change, geopolitical risk increases. A change in legislation, a
natural disaster, a terrorist attack, a heist, or a conflict could all result in a geopolitical risk shift.
Archetypes of Country Behavior
Based on political cooperation versus non-cooperation and globalization versus nationalism,
there are four archetypes of country behavior: Autarky, Hegemony, Multilateralism, and
Bilateralism.
Autarky
This refers to nations with little foreign trade or financing and seeking political independence.
122
© 2014-2024 AnalystPrep.Since they are self-sufficient, autarkic nations can exert complete control over the flow of
products, services, and technology. This makes them politically stronger.
During times of autarky, a nation's political and economic growth can advance more quickly. A
case in point is China in the 20th century. However, it can also result in a gradual loss of
economic development. North Korea qualifies as a good example in this regard.
Hegemony
Hegemonic nations often lead regions or the world, exerting political and economic control to
secure resources. Countries aligning with the hegemon gain access to the benefits it provides.
A country with a hegemonic system can influence global affairs, while countries aligning
themselves with the hegemon's rules may enjoy rewards from the global leader. However, as a
hegemon's influence dwindles, it may become more competitive and consequently increase
geopolitical risk. An example is Russia's influence on natural gas supply, which influences
countries that rely on its natural gas.
Multilateralism
These are nations that engage in rule harmonization and mutually beneficial trade agreements.
Their businesses have several trading partners and are totally linked to global supply chains. A
good example is Singapore. Among other benefits, multilateralism allows a country to access
resources and markets globally.
However, such a country may become highly dependent on international cooperation for its
economic growth. This makes them more vulnerable to geopolitical risk.
Bilateralism
Bilateralism is the practice of two nations cooperating in the political, economic, financial, or
cultural spheres. Even though bilateral agreements are made one at a time, governments that
engage in bilateralism may have relationships with several distinct nations.
Japan was once a bilateral country that built a strong export market for its products. Bilateral
123
© 2014-2024 AnalystPrep.agreements are not enough to deal with global issues such as global tax avoidance.
124
© 2014-2024 AnalystPrep.LOS 5e: describe tools of geopolitics and their impact on regions and
economies
Geopolitical tools refer to methods used by geopolitical actors to pitch their interests before
others. The tools an actor chooses to use are ultimately the sources of geopolitical risk.
Tools of geopolitics may be separated into:
i. National Security Tools: Tools for national security are those that are used to exercise
direct or indirect control over a state actor's access to resources, citizens, or borders.
National security tools can either be active (used at the time of analysis) or threatened
(not currently used, but their use is likely sufficient to call for concern). Armed combat is
one example. This has two primary effects:
The destruction of physical infrastructure.
The migration from areas of armed conflict.
ii. Economic Tools: These are the steps used to support cooperative or non-cooperative
positions through economic means. Common markets, global tariff rule harmonization,
and multilateral trade agreements are examples of economic tools. Economic
instruments may also be inherently non-cooperative. A non-cooperative strategy for
establishing economic power is nationalization.
iii. Financial Tools: These are the measures taken to support cooperative or non-
cooperative positions using financial mechanisms. They include enabling international
investment and free currency exchange across borders, as well as restraining foreign
investment and limiting access to local currency markets.
Financial instruments may lower geopolitical risk if they promote collaboration. These
same instruments may also lead to weaknesses in the global system by rendering other
nations susceptible to changes in other nations' policies. An example would be the
vulnerability to US monetary policy changes of countries that trade internationally using
the USD.
Multi-Faceted Approaches
125
© 2014-2024 AnalystPrep.It is possible to combine cooperative political, economic, and financial systems. An example is
cabotage. Cabotage allows a foreign firm to transport goods and passengers within a country.
Numerous nations, even those that have multilateral trade agreements, place limitations on
cabotage in all areas of transportation since cabotage requires coordination in areas like
economic coordination and physical security.
International organizations may utilize a variety of geopolitical tools to achieve their goals. Many
geopolitical actors are more likely to use cooperative tools and not non-cooperative tools/ initiate
conflicts with other actors.
126
© 2014-2024 AnalystPrep.Question
Which of the following would least likely be classified as a geopolitical tool?
A. Natural tools.
B. Financial tools.
C. Economic tools.
The correct answer is A.
Natural tools are not geopolitical tools. Geopolitical tools are devices used by
geopolitical actors to reinforce their interest with respect to others. There are three
types of geopolitical tools that geopolitical actors use: national security, economic,
and financial.
B is incorrect. Financial tools are geopolitical tools used by geopolitical actors. They
are used to reinforce cooperative and non-cooperative stances via financial
mechanisms such as free exchange of currencies across borders or limiting access to
local markets.
C is incorrect. Economic tools are geopolitical tools used by geopolitical actors.
They include multilateral trade agreements or common markets
127
© 2014-2024 AnalystPrep.LOS 5f: describe the impact of geopolitical risk on investments
The degree to which investors consider geopolitical risk when making decisions will significantly
depend on their investment goals and risk appetite. While certain investors may welcome
geopolitical risk, it may also be shunned by others in their decision-making process.
Types of Geopolitical Risks
The three primary types of geopolitical risk are:
i. Event Risk
Event risk is based on predetermined dates, such as elections, the enactment of new
laws, or other date-based events, such as festivals or political anniversaries. Investor
expectations frequently shift as a result of political events. Political timelines are a
common starting point for risk analysts when evaluating event risk.
ii. Exogenous Risk
Exogenous risk is an abrupt or unplanned risk that affects a nation's willingness to
cooperate and non-state actors' capacity to globalize. Unexpected revolutions, invasions,
or the aftermath of natural calamities are a few examples.
iii. Thematic Risks
Thematic risks are risks that are known, and they grow and evolve with time. Examples
include the persistent danger of terrorism, climate change, migratory patterns, the
emergence of populist movements, and cyber threats.
Evaluating Geopolitical Threats
In the financial environment, geopolitical risk is constantly present and has various effects on
assets. An investor evaluates geopolitical risk in terms of the following three categories:
i. Likelihood It will Occur
128
© 2014-2024 AnalystPrep.The likelihood of the occurrence of risk is the possibility that it will materialize. The
procedure of measuring likelihood is, however, difficult.
More collaborative and globalized nations are generally less likely to incur geopolitical
risk due to higher political, economic, and financial costs incurred by the partners
inflicting those risks. However, the same countries may also be more vulnerable to
certain risks. For instance, risks that affect the countries they cooperate with may also
affect them.
Internal political stability, economic need, and governmental actors' motivations all
contribute significantly to the likelihood of disruptive action.
ii. Velocity (Speed) of its Impact
This is the rate at which geopolitical risk affects an investor's portfolio. We will look at
short-term or "high velocity", medium-term, and long-term or "low velocity".
Short-term or high velocity may have an impact on the entire market. Exogenous or
“black swan” events will likely fall under this classification. Black-swan events are
unusual, unpredictable incidents that have a significant impact, for example, a world war.
Risks that have a medium-term impact may affect business operations, expenses, and
investment prospects, resulting in reduced valuations. They often target particular
industries and affect some businesses more than others.
Long-term risks might significantly affect the environment, society, government, and
other areas. Long-term risks may make investors change their asset allocations. Their
immediate effect on portfolios is, however, likely to be less significant.
Note:Some risks may affect investments with more than one speed of impact.
iii. Size and Nature of that Impact
The effects of risk on investor portfolios might take many different forms. When
evaluating the significance of a risk to the investing process, investors should consider
the magnitude of the risk's impact. A high risk may require a deep analysis of its drivers
129
© 2014-2024 AnalystPrep.and motivations whereas a low impact risk may not require as much analysis.
The nature of the impact might be discrete or broad. A discrete impact is one that only
affects one business or industry at a time. A broad impact, on the other hand, affects an
entire industry, a nation, or the whole global economy.
Investors should consider all three geopolitical risk factors—likelihood, velocity, size, and
nature of impact (together)—when evaluating geopolitical risk for portfolio management.
Note: A risk that is extremely probable but has minimal effect on a portfolio may not
warrant in-depth research and investor attention. However, a risk that is less likely to
occur but whose impact will be high may necessitate building a scenario for response,
but without regular monitoring and assessment
Impact of Geopolitical Risk
The effect of risks on investment portfolios can present itself in numerous ways. As such,
investors need to evaluate the magnitude of a risk's influence when determining its relevance in
the investment process. High-impact risks warrant extensive study, while low-impact risks do
not. External factors may also increase the size of a risk's impact, for instance, risk will have
more impact on markets experiencing contraction or economic downturn.
The impact of geopolitical risks can be classified as discrete (impacting a specific company or
sector) or broad (affecting larger sectors, countries, or the global market).
In managing portfolios with geopolitical risks in mind, investors should collectively consider all
three geopolitical risk factors (likelihood, velocity, and size and nature of impact). A risk that's
very probable but has minor implications might not require detailed scrutiny. Conversely, a risk
with substantial consequences but a low occurrence chance might necessitate response planning
without constant oversight.
Because geopolitical risks rarely develop in a linear fashion, we use scenario analysis and
signposting (and not a single-point forecast) to monitor their likelihood, velocity, and impact on a
portfolio.
130
© 2014-2024 AnalystPrep.Scenario Analysis
Scenario analysis is the analysis of portfolio outcomes across various situations or states of the
world to help teams understand their position with respect to a risk that might affect them. By
understanding their positions, teams can make good investment decisions at opportune times.
Scenario analysis might be qualitative, quantitative, or a combination of the two.
Creating a base case for an event is the first step in a simple qualitative scenario development.
Investors can then think about the positive and negative possibilities from there to create best
and worst-case scenarios.
The complexity of quantitative scenarios might vary greatly. A stylized scenario is a type of
simple quantitative scenario in which a portfolio's sensitivity is evaluated in relation to one
important aspect that is significant to it. Such an aspect could be interest rates, asset prices, or
exchange rates.
Scenario construction is a great technique for tracking risks and determining valuable portfolio
actions to take. However, it requires investors to consistently commit their time and efforts.
Tracking risks using signposts
A signpost is an indicator, a piece of data, or an event suggesting that risk is becoming more or
less likely.
A signpost is analogous of a traffic light. If both quantitative and qualitative data indicate that a
risk is minimal in terms of likelihood, velocity, or impact, then the signposts display a green
signal, implying no immediate action is necessary. If the color changes to amber (suggesting a
moderate level of risk in terms of likelihood, speed, or impact) it might be prudent to exercise
increased caution and readiness for that specific risk. If a risk increases in terms of likelihood,
velocity, or impact (turns red), it might be essential to formulate a response strategy.
The ability to recognize signposts should enable a team to distinguish between signal and noise
and respond when signposts indicate increased risk. It might be difficult to find the correct
131
© 2014-2024 AnalystPrep.signposts without some trial and error. It is therefore important for investors to differentiate
between policy and politics. For instance, two leaders can differ politically but the policies they
enact are the ones that will create a more durable portfolio impact.
Certain combinations of economic and financial market conditions can act as clear indicators of
impending trouble. For instance, increased inflation and declining employment may indicate
political turmoil.
Manifestations of Geopolitical Risk
Geopolitical risk can have different impacts on investor portfolios. High-velocity risks will
manifest in market volatility through prompt changes in asset prices such as commodities,
foreign exchange, stocks, and bond prices.
Low-velocity risk can lead to extended effects on investor inputs. Persistent disturbances can
cause reduced revenue, increased expenses, or a combination of both, potentially diminishing a
company's valuation.
Investors require higher compensation for their investments in countries or sectors perceived to
be more prone to geopolitical risk.
Acting on Geopolitical Risk
Assessing a risk's likelihood, velocity, and impact might assist an investor in isolating the risks
that may be the most significant.
Asset allocators can use a top-down approach to consider geopolitical risk in their asset
allocation strategy. Risks' likelihood, velocity, and impact may impact key capital market
assumptions and an asset allocator's positioning in some countries or regions.
Investors might consider geopolitical risk in multi-factor models at the portfolio management
level.
The importance of geopolitical risk to an investment process is dependent on an investor's
objectives, risk tolerance, and time horizon.
132
© 2014-2024 AnalystPrep.Question
Which of the following geopolitical risks is most likely a known risk that evolves and
expands over a period of time?
A. Event risk.
B. Thematic risk.
C. Exogenous risk.
The correct answer is B.
Thematic risk is a type of geopolitical risk that is known, evolves, and expands over a
period of time. Examples include climate change and ongoing threats of terrorism.
A is incorrect. Event risk is a type of geopolitical risk that revolves around set dates
or date-driven milestones such as elections or political anniversaries.
C is incorrect. Exogenous risk is a type of geopolitical risk. It is a sudden or
unanticipated risk that impacts a country's cooperative stance or the ability of non-
state actors to globalize. Examples include invasions and sudden uprisings.
133
© 2014-2024 AnalystPrep.LOS 5a: describe geopolitics from a cooperation versus competition
perspective
Geopolitics examines how geography influences national and international relations. Analysts in
this field examine actors, including individuals, organizations, companies, and national
governments, that engage in political, economic, and financial activities and their interactions.
State and Non-State Actors
The two main types of actors relevant to geopolitics are:
1. State actors.
2. Non-state actors.
State Actors
State actors often exercise authority over a nation's national security and resources. They do so
through national governments, political groups, or country leaders. State actors include
presidents, heads of government, and political parties.
Non-State Actors
Non-state actors engage in international political, economic, or financial activities without direct
access to a nation's resources or security. Examples of non-state actors include non-
governmental organizations (NGOs), multinational corporations, charitable groups, and even
influential people such as corporate executives or cultural celebrities.
State and non-state actors are influenced by their relationships and factors impacting their allies
and foes. As such, the international landscape consists of complex relationships that impact
events, decisions, and financial trends. While there is no universal model for geopolitical actors,
identifying and classifying a country's challenges and prospects can assist in predicting potential
geopolitical risks.
134
© 2014-2024 AnalystPrep.Moreover, we may be able to estimate the possibility of geopolitical risk by comprehending and
classifying the risks and opportunities a nation faces. Economic, financial, and national security
concerns, as well as social, cultural, and non-state actors, significantly impact nations and their
governments.
Features of Political Cooperation
Cooperation is the process by which nations get together to collaborate toward attaining a
common objective. Political cooperation is the degree to which countries work toward
agreements on rules and standardization for the activities and interactions between them.
At the most fundamental level, interactions between nations or national governments (State
actors) can either assume a cooperative or competitive/non-cooperative form.
A cooperative nation participates in and supports international accords on commerce,
immigration, and regulation. In addition, such a nation embraces standardization of laws, tariff
harmonization, and the free flow of information, including technology transfer.
On the other hand, a non-cooperative nation has erratic, often arbitrary policies and limits
cross-border trade in capital, goods, and people. Aside from all these, a non-cooperative nation
engages in retaliation and contributes little to technological exchange.
Reasons for Cooperations
Reasons why a country may cooperate with others include:
1. National Security or Military Interest: National security means safeguarding a
country and its people, economy, and institutions from external threats like terrorism and
natural disasters. Geographical factors play a significant role in a nation's approach to
national security and its level of cooperation. For example, countries with strong trade
connections, like Singapore, or those serving as trade hubs, like Panama, can impact
global dynamics due to their strategic locations.
135
© 2014-2024 AnalystPrep.2. Economic Interest. Social stability, another crucial element of national security, can be
enhanced by increasing national wealth and reducing income disparity. It is becoming
more vital for national companies to operate globally than before. Countries
collaborating for economic gains usually have two main goals: they want to create fair
opportunities for their businesses worldwide or secure essential resources through trade.
3. Geophysical Resource Endowment: Geophysical resource endowment, like favorable
geography and climate, along with access to food and water, is crucial for sustainable
growth. Different countries have varying levels of these resources, with some being self-
sufficient and others heavily reliant on others. These disparities can create power
imbalances. Nations with plenty of these resources might gain political influence over
those in need. But if these resources benefit only certain groups, it can lead to unrest
within the resource-rich country.
4. Standardization: Standardization is the process of defining protocols for the
manufacture, marketing, delivery, or usage of a good or service. There is a great need for
governments to work with others on the harmonization of the norms of engagement. The
agreement of all concerned parties to abide by these protocols amounts to
standardization. Standardization can take a variety of shapes, including operational
synchronization, process standardization, and regulatory collaboration.
An example of operational synchronization is containerization, in which case
standards are set for containers to ensure uniformity in size and shape. This
increases international trade by reducing costs and time of shipping goods.
An example of process standardization is the Society for Worldwide Interbank
Financial Telecommunication (SWIFT ), established to provide a global financial
infrastructure. The fact that financial transactions across borders had become
costly necessitated the establishment of SWIFT.
An example of regulatory collaboration is the Basel Committee on Banking
Supervision (BCBS), established to facilitate better supervision of the global
banking sector and international capital flows.
136
© 2014-2024 AnalystPrep.5. Cultural Considerations and “Soft Power”. Cultural factors may bind countries
together. These include enduring political relationships, migration trends, common
experiences, or cultural affinities. Countries may use soft power, a nonviolent method of
swaying the actions of another nation, in their international engagements. Soft power
can be developed gradually through initiatives such as cultural programs, advertising,
travel scholarships, and university exchanges.
Hierarchy of Interests
The national interest of a country encompasses its goals and ambitions. For some countries,
geography plays a major role in defining their national interests. This can include seeking self-
determination, striving for independence, establishing clear national boundaries, or desiring
territorial expansion.
Meanwhile, other countries perceive national interest in a broader context, factoring in the
economic and social aspects mentioned earlier. This holistic perspective may lead to conflict
among a nation's multiple critical priorities, making the analysis of geopolitical players and their
intentions more complex.
A country's national interest can be thought of as a hierarchy with survival as the top priority
and less crucial factors below. Governments use this hierarchy to guide their decisions, choosing
cooperation when it benefits the nation. When conflicting interests arise, the higher-ranked
interest takes priority.
As an illustration, while tariff alignment might favorably impact a nation, the collaboration could
come at a significant price if the countries involved have military disagreements. Should military
objectives rank higher in these countries' interest hierarchies, they might find it against their
national interest to collaborate, notwithstanding any possible advantages.
Power of the Decision Maker
137
© 2014-2024 AnalystPrep.The national interest hierarchy may become less consequential in a scenario where the priorities
of a new government differ from those of the government that preceded it. Further, the duration
of a nation's electoral cycle significantly affects priority classification. Each of the political
parties and individuals making decisions at the national level has its own set of interests and
influences. It is crucial to appreciate that the motivations of decision-makers can influence a
nation's cooperative and non-cooperative decisions.
The Role of Institutions
Institutions are established organizations in a society. They can manifest as formal entities, like
universities and legal organizations. Conversely, they can also be informal, such as customs or
behavioral patterns important to a society.
Not all institutions are born from government initiatives; they can also emerge from NGOs,
charities, spiritual rituals, familial structures, the media sphere, political factions, and
educational methodologies.
Solid and robust institutions often lead to a more predictable political climate both domestically
and abroad. This predictability fosters a conducive environment for nurturing collaborative
alliances.
Countries with robust institutions that focus on government transparency, the rule of law, and
property rights gain more respect and independence on the global stage. These institutions not
only strengthen alliances but also ensure the longevity of these partnerships.
138
© 2014-2024 AnalystPrep.Question
Which of the following is least likely a reason why a country may want to cooperate
with others?
A. National security.
B. Economic interest.
C. Political self-determination.
The correct answer is C.
Political self-determination is a reason why a country may be non-cooperative.
Countries where political self-determination is more important than the benefits of
any cooperation take a non-cooperative stance.
A is incorrect. National security is a motivation for cooperation. It involves
protecting the country from such external threats as military invasion, cyber-security,
and natural disasters.
B is incorrect. Economic interest is another motivation for cooperation. Countries
choose to cooperate to secure essential resources through trade or to level the
playing field for their companies or industries.
