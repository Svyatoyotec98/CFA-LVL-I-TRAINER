Williamson is a widow who heavily relies on her investment portfolio to fund her children's college education. In addition, her financial circumstances are such that she cannot afford taking high levels of risk. Travis is currently exploring a highly leveraged hedge fund that takes positions in emerging market securities. She allocates holdings of the fund to the majority of her clients' account but purposely excludes Williamson's account. After learning of the hedge fund allocation, Williamson writes a letter to Travis indicating that she was treated unfairly.
