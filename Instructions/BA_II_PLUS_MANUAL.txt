10 digits with the floating-decimal option. Results exceeding 10 digits appear in
scientific notation.
Changing the number of decimal places affects the display only. Except for
amortization and depreciation results, the calculator does not round internal values. To
round the internal value, use the round function.
Note: All examples in this guidebook assume a setting of two decimal places. Other
settings might show different results.

Choosing the Angle Units
The angle unit value affects the display of results in trigonometric calculations. When
you select radians, the RAD indicator appears in the upper right corner of the display.
No indicator appears when you select the default setting of degrees.
Using Dates
The calculator uses dates with the Bond and Date worksheets and the French
depreciation methods. To enter dates, use this convention: mm.ddyy (US) or dd.mmyy
(European). After you key in the date, press !.
Choosing Calculation Methods
When you choose the chain (Chn) calculation method, the calculator solves problems in
the order that you enter them. (Most financial calculators use Chn.)
For example, when you enter 3 H 2 < 4 N, the Chn answer is 20 (3 + 2 = 5, 5 * 4 = 20).
Using AOS™(algebraic operating system), the calculator solves problems according to
the standard rules of algebraic hierarchy, computing multiplication and division
operations before addition and subtraction operations. (Most scientific calculators use
AOS.)
For example, when you enter 3 H 2 < 4 N, the AOS answer is 11 (2 Q 4 = 8; 3 + 8 =
11).
Resetting Default Values
To reset default values for all of the calculator formats, press & z with one
of the formats displayed.
Resetting the Calculator
Resetting the calculator:
•
Clears the display, all 10 memories, any unfinished
calculations, and all worksheet data.
•

•
Returns operation to the standard-calculator mode
Because the calculator includes alternative methods that let you clear data selectively,
use reset carefully to avoid losing data needlessly. (See section “Clearing Calculator
Entries and Memories”.)
For example, you might reset the calculator before using it for the first time, when
starting a new calculation, or when having difficulty operating the calculator and other
possible solutions do not work. (See “In Case of Difficulty”.)

* The random number you generate might be different.
** Angles can be computed in degrees or radians. Examples show angles in degrees.
(See: Choosing the Angle Units).
Universal Power ;
Press ; to raise the displayed postive number to any power (for example, 2-5 or 2
(1/3).)
Note: Because the reciprocal of an even number (such as, 1/2, 1/4, 1/6) is a complex
number, you can only raise a negative number to an integer power or the reciprocal of
an odd number.
Parentheses 9 :
Use parentheses to control the order in which the calculator evaluates a numeric
expression in division, multiplication, powers, roots, and logarithm calculations. The
calculator includes up to 15 levels of parentheses and up to 8 pending operations.
Note: You do not have to press : for expressions ending in a series of closed
parentheses. Pressing N closes parentheses automatically, evaluates the expression,
and displays the final result. To view intermediate results, press : once for each open
parenthesis.
Factorial & g
The number for which you compute a factorial must be a positive integer less than or
equal to 69.
Random Numbers & a
The calculator generates a random real number between zero and one (0<x<1) from a
uniform distribution.
You can repeat a sequence of random numbers by storing a seed value in the random
number generator. Seed values help you recreate experiments by generating the same
series of random numbers.
To store a seed value, key in an integer greater than zero and press D & a.
Combinations & s
The calculator computes the number of combinations of n items taken r at a time.
Both the n and r variables must be greater than 0.
Permutations & m
The calculator computes the number of permutations of n items taken r at a time.
Both the n and r variables must be greater than 0.

Rounding & o
The calculator computes using the rounded, displayed form of a number instead of the
internally stored value.
For example, working in the Bond worksheet, you might want to round a computed
selling price to the nearest penny (two decimal places) before continuing your
calculation.
Note: The calculator stores values to an accuracy of up to 13 digits. The decimal format
setting rounds the displayed value but not the unrounded, internally stored value. (See
“Choosing the Number of Decimal Places Displayed”.)
Scientific Notation ;
When you compute a value in the standard-decimal format that is either too large or
small to be displayed, the calculator displays it in scientific notation, that is, a base
value (or mantissa), followed by a blank space, followed by an exponent.
With AOS selected, you can press ; to enter a number in scientific notation. (See
“Choosing Calculation Methods”.)
For example, to enter 3 Q 103, key in 3 < 10 ; 3.
Memory Operations

Time-Value-of-Money and Amortization Worksheets
Use the Time-Value-of-Money (TVM) variables to solve
problems with equal and regular cash flows that are either
all inflows or all outflows (for example, annuities, loans,
mortgages, leases, and savings).
For cash-flow problems with unequal cash flows, use the
Cash Flow worksheet. (See: Cash Flow Worksheet.)
After solving a TVM problem, you can use the Amortization worksheet to generate an
amortization schedule.
•
To access a TVM variable, press a TVM key (,, -, ., /,or 0).

Using the TVM and Amortization Variables
Because the calculator stores values assigned to the TVM variables until you clear or
change them, you should not have to perform all steps each time you work a problem.
•
To assign a value to a TVM variable, key in a number and press a TVM key (,, -,
., /, 0).
•
To change the number of payments (P/Y), press & [, key in a number, and
press !. To change the compounding periods (C/Y), press & [ #, key in a
number, and press !.
•
To change the payment period (END/BGN), press & ], and then press &
V.
•
To compute a value for the unknown variable, press C, and then press the key
for the unknown variable.

Clearing the Unused Variable
For problems using only four of the five TVM variables, enter a value of zero for the
unused variable.
For example, to determine the present value (PV) of a known future value (FV) with a
known interest rate (I/Y) and no payments, enter 0 and press PMT.
Entering Positive and Negative Values for Outflows and Inflows
Enter negative values for outflows (cash paid out) and positive values for inflows (cash
received).
Note: To enter a negative value, press S after entering the number. To change a
negative value to positive, press S.
Entering Values for I/Y, P/Y, and C/Y
•
Enter I/Y as the nominal interest rate. The TVM worksheet automatically converts
I/Y to a per period rate based on the values of P/Y and C/Y.
•
Entering a value for P/Y automatically enters the same value for C/Y. (You can
change C/Y.)
Specifying Payments Due With Annuities
Use END/BGN to specify whether the transaction is an ordinary annuity or an annuity
due.
•
Set END for ordinary annuities, in which payments occur at the end of each
payment period. (This category includes most loans.)
•
Set BGN for annuities due, in which payments occur at the beginning of each
payment period. (This category includes most leases.)
Note: When you select beginning-of-period payments, the BGN indicator appears. (No
indicator appears for END payments.)
Updating P1 and P2
To update P1 and P2 for a next range of payments, press C with P1 or P2 displayed.
Different Values for BAL and FV
The computed value for BAL following a specified number of payments might be
different than the computed value for FV following the same number of payments.
•
When solving for BAL, PRN, and INT, the calculator uses the PMT value rounded to
the number of decimal places specified by the decimal format.
•
When solving for FV, the calculator uses the unrounded value for PMT.

Entering, Recalling, and Computing TVM Values
•
To enter a TVM value, key in the value and store it by pressing a TVM key (,, -,
., /, 0).
•
To display a stored TVM value, press J and a TVM key.
You can enter or recall a value for any of the five TVM variables (N, I/Y, PV, PMT, or FV)
in either the standard calculator mode or a worksheet mode. The information
displayed depends on which mode is selected.
•
In standard calculator mode, the calculator displays the variable label, the = sign,
and the value entered or recalled.
•
In worksheet modes the calculator displays only the value you enter or recall,
although any variable label previously displayed remains displayed.
Note: You can tell that the displayed value is not assigned to the displayed variable,
because the = indicator is not displayed.

A perpetual annuity can be an ordinary annuity or an annuity due consisting of equal
payments continuing indefinitely (for example, a preferred stock yielding a constant
dollar dividend).
Perpetual ordinary annuity
Perpetual annuity due

Because the term (1 + I/Y / 100)-N in the present value annuity equations approaches
zero as N increases, you can use these equations to solve for the present value of a
perpetual annuity:

Computing Cash Flows
The calculator solves for these cash-flow values:
•
Net present value (NPV) is the total present value of all cash flows, including
inflows (cash received) and outflows (cash paid out). A positive NPV value
indicates a profitable investment.
•
Net future value (NFV) is the total future value of all cash flows. A positive NFV
value also indicates a profitable investment.
•
Payback (PB) is the time required to recover the initial cost of an investment,
disregarding the present value of the cash inflows (time value of money).
•
Discounted payback (DPB) is the time required to recover the initial cost of an
investment using the present value of the cash inflows (time value of money).
•
Internal rate of return (IRR) is the interest rate at which the net present value of
the cash flows is equal to 0.
•
Modified internal rate of return (MOD) considers the reinvestment of cash when
solving for IRR.

When solving for IRR, the calculator performs a series of complex, iterative calculations
that can take seconds or even minutes to complete. The number of possible IRR
solutions depends on the number of sign changes in your cash-flow sequence.
•
When a sequence of cash flows has no sign changes, no IRR solution exists. The
calculator displays Error 5.
•
When a sequence of cash flows has only one sign change, only one IRR solution
exists, which the calculator displays.
•
When a sequence of cash flows has two or more sign changes:
-
At least one solution exists.
-
As many solutions can exist as there are sign changes.
When more than one solution exists, the calculator displays the one closest to zero.
Because the displayed solution has no financial meaning, you should use caution in
making investment decisions based on an IRR computed for a cash-flow stream
with more than one sign change.

The time line reflects a sequence of cash flows with three sign changes, indicating
that one, two, or three IRR solutions can exist.
•
When solving complex cash-flow problems, the calculator might not find PB, DPB,
IRR, and MOD, even if a solution exists. In this case, the calculator displays Error 7
(iteration limit exceeded).
Example: Solving for Unequal Cash Flows
These examples show you how to enter and edit unequal cash-flow data to calculate:

Example: Value of a Lease with Uneven Payments
A lease with an uneven payment schedule usually accommodates seasonal or other
anticipated fluctuations in the lessee’s cash position.
A 36-month lease has the following payment schedule and beginning-of-period
payments.

•
What is the present value of these lease payments?
Cash Flow Worksheet
44

45
Cash Flow Worksheet
•
What even payment amount at the beginning of each month would result in the
same present value?
Because the cash flows are uneven, use the Cash Flow worksheet to determine the net
present value of the lease.
Computing NPV
The cash flows for the first four months are stated as a group of four $0 cash flows.
Because the lease specifies beginning-of-period payments, you must treat the first
cash flow in this group as the initial investment (CFo) and enter the remaining three
cash flows on the cash flow screens (C01 and F01).

Bond Worksheet
Bond Worksheet Terminology
Term
Definition
Call Date
A callable bond bond can be retired by the issuing agency
before the maturity date. The call date for such a bond is
printed in the bond contract.
Coupon Payment
The periodic payment made to the owner of the bond as
interest.
Coupon Rate
The annual interest rate printed on the bond.
Dollar Price
Price of the security expressed in terms of dollars per
$100 of par value.
Par (Face) Value
The value printed on the bond.
Premium Bond
A bond that sells for an amount greater than the par
value.
Discount Bond
A bond selling for less than the par value.
Redemption Date
The date on which the issuing agency retires the bond.
This date can be the date of maturity or, for a callable
bond, the call date.
Redemption Value
The amount paid to the owner of a bond when retired. If
the bond is redeemed at the maturity date, the
redemption value is the par value printed on the bond. If
the bond is redeemed at a call date, the redemption value
is the bond’s par value plus any call premium. The
calculator treats the redemption value in terms of dollars
per $100 of par value.
Settlement Date
The date on which a bond is exchanged for funds.
Yield to Maturity
The rate of return earned from payments of principal and
interest, with interest compounded semiannually at the
stated yield rate. The yield to maturity takes into account
the amount of premium or discount, if any, and the time
value of the investment.
Entering Bond Data and Computing Results

Computing Values for DEP, RBV, and RDV
•
The calculator computes one year at a time and rounds the results to the number
of decimal places set. Setting Calculator Formats
•
The calculator computes values for DEP, RBV, and RDV automatically when you
press # to display each variable.
Entering Values for DB and DBX
If you choose either the declining balance (DB) or declining balance with crossover to SL
(DBX) depreciation method, remember to enter a value representing the percent of
declining balance for the DB or DBX variable.
Note: The declining balance you enter must be a positive number.
Entering Values for LIF
•
If SL or SLF is selected, the LIF value must be a positive real number.
•
If SYD, DB, DBX, or DBF is selected, the LIF value must be a positive integer.
Entering Values for M01
The value you enter for the starting month (M01) has two parts:
•
The integer portion represents the month in which the asset is placed into service.
•
The decimal portion represents the fraction of the initial month in which the asset
begins to depreciate.
For example, to specify that the asset will begin to depreciate in the middle of the first
month, enter 1.5. To specify that the asset will begin to depreciate a quarter of the
way through the fourth month, enter 4.25.

Working with YR
•
When computing depreciation, the value you enter for the year-to-compute (YR)
variable must be a positive integer.
•
If the remaining depreciable value (RDV) variable is displayed, you can press # to
return to the year to compute (YR) variable. To represent the next depreciation
year, press C to increment the value for YR by one.

and Y, press & } !.
Entering Data Points
•
You can enter up to 50 (x,y) data points.
•
If you press # or " to move through the portion of the worksheet that displays
results without entering data points, the calculator will display an error.
•
When you enter data for one-variable statistics, Xnn represents the value and Ynn
specifies the number of occurrences (frequency).
•
When you enter a value for Xnn, the value for Ynn defaults to 1.
Analyzing One-Variable Statistics
To analyze one-variable statistics, select 1-V. Only values for n, v, Sx, sX, GX, and GX2
are computed and displayed for one-variable statistics.
Analyzing Two-Variable Statistics
You can choose from among these four regression-analysis methods:
•
LIN
•
Ln
•
EXP
•
PWR
Computing Values Automatically
Except for the predicted X' and Y' values, the calculator computes and displays values
for statistics variables automatically when you access them.
Using X' and Y' for Regression Predictions
To use the X' and Y' variables for regression predictions, you either can enter a value
for X' to compute Y' or enter a value for Y' to compute X'.
Regression Models
For two-variable data, the Statistics worksheet uses four regression models for curve
fitting and forecasting.

Model
Formula
Restrictions
LIN
Y = a + b X
None
Ln
Y = a + b ln(X)
All X values > zero
EXP
Y = a bx
All Y values > zero
PWR
Y = a Xb
All X and Y values > zero
The calculator interprets the X value as the independent variable and the Y value as the
dependent variable.
The calculator computes the statistical results using these transformed values:
•
LIN uses X and Y.
•
Ln uses ln(X) and Y.
•
EXP uses X and ln(Y).
•
PWR uses ln(X) and ln(Y).
The calculator determines the values for a and b that create the line or curve that best
fits the data.
Correlation Coefficient
The calculator also determines r, the correlation coefficient, which measures the
goodness of fit of the equation with the data. Generally:
•
The closer r is to 1 or -1, the better the fit.
•
The closer r is to zero, the worse the fit.
Entering Statistical Data
Because the Statistics worksheet lets you enter and display up to 50 data points, and
then stores the values until you clear the worksheet or change the values, you probably
will not have to perform every step for each Statistics calculation.
1.
To select the data-entry portion of the Statistics worksheet, press & j. X01 is
displayed along with any previous value.
2.
To clear the worksheet, press & z.

Comparing the Nominal Interest Rate of Investments
Comparing the nominal interest rate (annual percentage rate) of investments is
misleading when the investments have the same nominal rate but different numbers
of compounding periods per year.
To make a more valid comparison, convert the nominal interest rate (NOM) to the
annual effective interest rate (EFF) for each investment.
•
The nominal interest rate (NOM) is the interest rate per compounding period
multiplied by the number of compounding periods per year.
•
The annual effective interest rate (EFF) is the compound annual interest rate that
you actually earn for the period of time stated.

Number of Days I = (Y1 -YB) Q 365
+ (number of days MB to M1)
+ DT1

Number of Days II = (Y2 -YB) Q 365
+ (number of days MB to M2)
+ DT2
where:
M1 = month of first date
DT 1 = day of first date
Y 1 = year of first date

Note: The method assumes 30 days per month and 360 days per year.
where:
M1 = month of first date
DT 1 = day of first date
Y 1 = year of first date
M 2 = month of second date
DT 2 = day of second date
Y 2 = year of second date
Note: If DT1 is 31, change DT1 to 30. If DT2 is 31 and DT1 is 30 or 31, change DT2 to

Accuracy Information
The calculator stores results internally as 13-digit numbers but displays them rounded
to 10 digits or fewer, depending on the decimal format. The internal digits, or guard
digits, increase the calculator’s accuracy. Additional calculations use the internal value,
not the value displayed.
Rounding
If a calculation produces a result with 11-digits or more, the calculator uses the
internal guard digits to determine how to display the result. If the eleventh digit of the
result is 5 or greater, the calculator rounds the result to the next larger value for
display.
For example, consider this problem.
1 P 3 Q 3 = ?
Internally, the calculator solves the problem in two steps, as shown below.
1.
1 P 3 = 0.3333333333333
2.
0.3333333333333 Q 3 = 0.9999999999999
The calculator rounds the result and displays it as 1. This rounding enables the
calculator to display the most accurate result.
Although most calculations are accurate to within ±1 in the last displayed digit, higher-
order mathematical functions use iterative calculations, in which inaccuracies can
accumulate in the guard digits. In most cases, the cumulative error from these
calculations is maintained beyond the 10-digit display so that no inaccuracy is shown.
