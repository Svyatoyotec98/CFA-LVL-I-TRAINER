III As always, the first step involves formulating a relevant hypothesis. We are concerned that the earnings of the insurance company could be greater (more variant) than those of the banking industry. Therefore, the appropriate hypothesis is: H0: s1 2 s 2 2 and H1: s 1 2 > s 2 2 Where s 1 2 is the variance of earnings for the insurance industry, and s 2 2 is the corresponding variance for the banking industry. Next in line is the selection of the test statistic. When comparing the variances of two different populations, we use the F-statistic, computed as: F = (S1 2/S2 2) where S1 2 and S2 2 are the sample variances The F-statistic has (n1 - 1, n2 - 2) degrees of freedom. i.e. F30,40 F = 4.82/4.32 = 1.2461 Note that this is a one-sided test. As such, our critical value should be the upper 5% point of the F-distribution with (30, 40) degrees of freedom. This value = 1.74 Since 1.2461 is less than 1.74, it lies in the non-rejection, and therefore, we have insufficient evidence to reject H0 at the 5% level of significance.

The F-statistic tests the null hypothesis that all regression coefficients are equal to zero, meaning no relationship exists between the dependent and independent variables. A higher F-statistic value leads to the rejection of this null hypothesis, suggesting that the model has at least one significant predictor variable. Therefore, a model with a higher F-statistic is generally considered to provide a better representation of the relationship between variables.",
            "C": "The standard error of estimate ( ) measures the average distance that the observed values fall from the regression line. A lower indicates that the model has a tighter fit to the observed data, as the observed values are closer to the predicted values. This implies that the model with a lower would more accurately represent the relationship between auto sales and bank financing rates, as it suggests less dispersion of the observed values around the fitted values. Therefore, a model with a lower is preferable for accurately representing the relationship between variables."

The availability of large datasets, such as sensor data from satellites, online activity logs, and the Internet of Things (IoT) devices, has certainly fueled the growth of big data.

While executing coded instructions is a fundamental capability of computers and machines, it does not encompass the concept of learning or the ability to improve performance on tasks over time without being explicitly programmed to do so. Traditional computer programs operate based on predefined rules and instructions provided by humans, without the ability to learn or adapt.

            "C": "The ability to execute large trades is indeed a feature of algorithmic trading, particularly through techniques such as order slicing, which breaks down large orders into smaller, less market-disruptive transactions. However, this capability, while valuable, is not the primary reason for the increased adoption of algorithmic trading. The fragmentation of financial markets and the subsequent need to efficiently access and trade across these diverse venues are more significant factors driving the adoption of algorithmic trading strategies. The capacity to handle large trades, although beneficial, supports the broader objective of optimizing trade execution across multiple market destinations."
