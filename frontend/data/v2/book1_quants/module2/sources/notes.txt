Learning Module 2: The Time Value of Money in Finance
LOS 2a: calculate and interpret the present value (PV) of fixed-income
and equity instruments based on expected future cash flows
The time value of money (TVM) is a fundamental financial concept. It emphasizes that a sum of
money is worth more in the present than in the future. There are three key reasons supporting
this principle:
The concept of opportunity cost suggests that money available today can be invested
and generate interest, increasing its value over time. By delaying the use of money, one
forgoes potential investment opportunities and the growth they offer.
Inflation poses a threat to the purchasing power of money in the future. Due to
inflation, the same amount of money may buy fewer goods or services in the future
compared to its present value. Consequently, having money now is advantageous since
its purchasing power diminishes as time progresses.
There is an element of uncertainty regarding future cash flows. Unexpected events
or circumstances may prevent the receipt of money as planned, rendering it less
reliable. Until the money is obtained, there is a level of uncertainty attached to its
availability and utility.
Time value of money calculations allow us to establish the future value of a given amount of
money.
Key Components of Time Value of Money
Discount rate or interest rate: The rate of discounting or compounding that you
apply to an amount of money to calculate its present or future value.
Time periods: The whole number of time periods over which the present or future
value of a sum is being calculated. These periods can be annually, semi-annually,
quarterly, monthly, weekly, etc.
31
© 2014-2024 AnalystPrep.Present value (PV): The amount of money you have today (or at time T = 0) is
referred to as the present value.
Future value (FV): The accumulated amount of money you get after investing the
original sum at a specific interest rate and for a given time period, say, two years.
Fundamental Formulas in Time Value of Money Calculations:
Let,
FV = Future value.
PV = Present value.
r = Stated discount rate per period.
N = Number of periods (Years).
Then the future value (FV) of an investment is given by:
FV PV(1+r)N
=
If N is large such that N →∞ the initial cashflow is compounded continuously:
FV =PVerN
To find the present value of the investment, we rewrite the above formula so that:
PV =FV(1+r)−N
And for the continuous compounding, we have,
PV =FVe−rN
t
Example: Calculating the Present Value of continuously Compounded Cashflows
A fund continuously accumulates to $4,000 over ten years at a 10% annual interest rate.
32

Solution
From the question, FV=4,000, r =10%, N=10
s
So,
PV = FVe−Nrs =$4,000×e−10×0.1 =$1,471.5178
Frequency of Compounding
When the frequency of compounding is more than once per year (quarterly, monthly, etc.), the
formulas are analogously defined as:
r mN
FV =PV(1+ s )
N m
Where:
m = Number of compounding periods per year.
N = Number of years.
r = Annual stated rate of interest.
s
Intuitively, the formula for the PV is given by:
r −mN
PV =FV(1+ s)
m
In the following discussion, we shall let t =mN denote the number of compounding periods and
rs =r denote the stated discount rate per period.
m
Calculation using a Financial Calculator
For calculating FV and PV using the BA II PlusTM Financial Calculator, use the following keys:
N = Number of compounding periods.
33
© 2014-2024 AnalystPrep.I/Y = Rate per period.
PV = Present value.
FV = Future value.
PMT = Payment.
CPT = Compute.
It is important to note that the sign of PV and FV will be opposite. For example, if PV is
negative, then FV will be positive. Generally, an inflow is entered with a positive sign, while an
outflow is entered as a negative sign in the calculator.
Time Value of Money in Fixed-income Instruments
Fixed-income instruments are debt securities where an issuer borrows money from an investor
(lender) in exchange for a promised future payment. Examples of fixed-income instruments are
bonds, loans, and notes.
The market discount rate for fixed-income instruments is also known as yield-to-maturity (YTM).
It's the interest rate investors require to invest in a specific fixed-income instrument.
Cash Flow Patterns Associated with Fixed-Income Instruments
The cash flows in fixed-income instruments occur in three general patterns: Discount, periodic
interest, and level payments.
Discount Cash Flow Patterns
For discount cashflow patterns, an investor pays an initial discounted price (PV) for the
instrument (such as a bond or a loan) and gets one payment (FV) at the end maturity. The
investor's return is the interest earned, that is, the difference between the initial price and
principle (FV −PV).
The discount bonds are also called zero-coupon bonds – they do not have periodic interest
34

The price of a discount bond can be calculated using the formula for the present value (PV) of a
single cash flow, which is as follows:
PV =FV(1+r)−t
t
Where:
FV = Future value.
PV = Present value.
r = Stated discount rate per period.
t = Number of compounding periods.
Example: Calculating the Future Value of a Zero-Coupon Bond
35
© 2014-2024 AnalystPrep.Assume Chad invests $8,000 in a zero-coupon bond that yields 8% annually and matures in four
years. The maturity value of this bond is closest to:
Solution
Recall that:
FV = PV(1+r)t
In this case, we have PV=8,000, r=8%, t=4 so that:
FV =8,000(1+8%)4 =10,883.91

A coupon instrument is a fixed-income investment. It includes periodic cash flows called coupons
and repays the principal at maturity. People often use these in coupon bond investments. These
instruments have a set schedule with regular, equal payments.
The pricing of a coupon bond involves calculating its present value (PV) based on the market
discount rate. The general formula for calculating the bond's price is derived from the
discounted cash flow model. It considers the coupon payments (PMTs) and the final principal
payment (FV) at maturity. The bond's price is determined by discounting each cash flow using
the market discount rate (r).
The formula used to calculate the present value (PV) of a coupon bond is as follows:
PMT PMT (PMT N +FV N )
PV(Coupon Bond) = + +...+
(1+r)1 (1+r)2 (1+r)N
Where:
37
© 2014-2024 AnalystPrep.PMT = Coupon payment.
FV = Future value.
r = Market discount rate (YTM).
N = Number of periods.
Example 1: Pricing a Coupon Bond on an Annual Basis
Suppose we have a 5-year bond with a face value of $1,000 and an annual coupon rate of 5%.
The market discount rate is 6%. The bond’s price is closest to:
Solution
PMT PMT (PMT N +FV N )
PV(Coupon Bond)= + +⋯+
(1+r)1 (1+r)2 (1+r)N
In this case, we have PMT=5% of $1,000=$50, r=6%, N=5 years, FV=$1,000 so that:
$50 $50 $50 $50
PV = + + +
(1+0.06)1 (1+0.06)2 (1+0.06)3 (1+0.06)4

© 2014-2024 AnalystPrep.Suppose an investor has a 2-year bond with a face value of $1000 and an annual coupon rate of
6%, paid semi-annually. The market discount rate is 5%. The price of the bond is closest to:
Solution
Recall that:
PMT PMT (PMT N +FV N )
PV(Coupon Bond) = + +...+
(1+r)1 (1+r)2 (1+r)N

N = Number of periods (4 periods in this case).

Perpetual bonds are rare types of coupon bonds that do not have a stated date of maturity. They
are generally issued by firms seeking equity-like financing and usually include redemption
provisions.
The formula present value of perpetual bonds is obtained as follows: As N →∞, the formula for
calculating PV of coupon changes as follows:
PV (perpetual bond)

Example: Perpetual Bond
In 2021, XYZ Financial (the holding company for XYZ Bank) issued $500 million in perpetual
bonds with a 4.00 percent semi-annual coupon. Calculate the bond's yield to maturity (YTM) if
the market price was $98.50 (per $100).

Level Payments (Annuity Instruments) Patterns
An annuity is a finite series of cash flows, all with the same value. A fixed-income instrument
with annuity payments provides a stream of periodic equal cash inflows over a finite period.
The level payments consist of interest and principal payments. Fixed income instruments with
level payments include fully amortizing loans such as mortgages.
There are two types of annuities: ordinary annuities and annuities due. Annuity due is a type of
annuity where payments start immediately at the beginning of time, at time t =0. In other
words, payments are made at the beginning of each period.
On the other hand, an ordinary annuity is an annuity where the cashflows occur at the end of
each period. Such payments are said to be made in arrears (beginning at time t = 1). We shall
consider ordinary annuity in this section.
Ordinary Annuity
Remember that in an ordinary annuity, the series of payments does not begin immediately.
Instead, payments are made at the end of each period. It is further worth noting that the present
value of an annuity is equal to the sum of the current value of each annuity payment:
41
© 2014-2024 AnalystPrep.PV = A(1+ r)−1+ A(1 +r)−2+...+A(1+ r)−N−1+ A(1+ r)−N
= A(1+ r)−1+ (1+ r)−2+...+(1+ r)−(N−1)+ (1 +r)−N
1− (1 +r)N
PV = A
r
Where:
A = Periodic cash flow.
r = Market interest rate per.
PV = Present value/ Principal Amount of the loan or bond.
N = Number of payment periods.
The periodic annuity is calculated as follows:
r(PV)
A=
(1−(1+r)−N
Consider a fully amortizing mortgage loan. In this case, the borrower receives the mortgage loan
now and promises to make periodic payments equal to the sum of interest and principal
payments.
42
© 2014-2024 AnalystPrep.Note that the periodic mortgage payment is constant, but the proportion of the interest payment
decreases while the principal payment increases.
The cash flow pattern of a fully amortizing mortgage follows the pattern of an ordinary annuity
with a series of equal cash flows. As such, the periodic annuity (periodic payment) of a fully
amortizing mortgage is given by:
r(PV)
A=
1−(1+r)−t
Where:
43
© 2014-2024 AnalystPrep.A = Periodic cash flow.
r = Market interest rate per period.
PV = Present value or principal amount of loan or bond.
t = Number of payment periods.
Example: Calculating the Periodic Payment of a Mortgage
Jake is looking to secure a fixed-rate 25-year mortgage to finance 75% of the value of an
$800,000 residential property. If the annual interest rate on the mortgage is 4.5%, Jake's monthly
mortgage payment is close to:

Time Value of Money in Equity Instruments
Equity investments, such as stocks, enable an investor to acquire a fractional share/ownership by
the issuing company. This gives investors the right to receive a share of the company's available
cash flows as dividends.
In the context of equity instruments, the time value of money (TVM) is used to discount expected
future cash flows to determine their present value. This allows investors to value the company
shares.
The present value of expected future cash flows is calculated using a discount rate, r, which
represents the expected rate of return on the investment.
Common Approaches for Valuing Equity Instruments
Valuing equity investments depends on the dividends cashflows which can take one of three
forms: constant dividends, constant dividend growth rate, and changing dividend growth rate.
1. Valuing Equity Instruments based on Constant Dividend: The Constant Dividends model
values stocks based on the assumption that dividends will remain constant over time. The
45
© 2014-2024 AnalystPrep.preferred or common share dividend cash flows are in the form of an infinite series that is valued
like perpetuity. The formula for the constant dividends model is as follows:
∞
D D
PV = ∑ t = t
t
(1+ r)i r
i=1
Where:PV = Present value at time t
t
D = Dividend payment at time t
t
r = Discount rate.
Example: Valuing Equity Instruments based on Constant Dividend
Assuming we have a preferred stock with a dividend payment of $5 per year. The discount rate is
8%. The present value of the stock is closest to:
Solution
Recall,
D
t
PV =
t
r
In this case, D=$5, r=8%, PV=?
So,
5
PV = = $62.5
0.08
This means that the present value of the stock is $62.5.
2. Valuing Equity Instruments Based on Constant Dividend Growth Rate The constant
dividend growth model is a method used to estimate the value of a stock based on its future
dividends. This model assumes that dividends will grow at a constant rate (g) forever. To derive
46
© 2014-2024 AnalystPrep.the formula for this model, we start by considering that the present value of a stock is equal
to the sum of its future dividends, discounted by the required rate of return r. If dividends
are assumed to grow at a constant rate, then each future dividend can be calculated by
multiplying the previous dividend by (1+g).
Let D represent the expected dividend in the next period. The present value of the stock can
t
then be expressed as:
D D (1 +g) D (1+ g)2
t t t
PV = + + + …
t
(1+ r) (1 +r)2 (1+ r)3
∞ D (1 +g)
t
= ∑
(1+ r)i
i=1
(1+r)
This is an infinite geometric series with a common ratio of . Using the formula for the sum of
(1+g)
an infinite geometric series, we can simplify this equation to:
D (1+ g) D
t t+1
PV = =
t
r− g r− g
Where:
PV = Present value at time t.
t
D = Expected Dividend in the next period.
t+1
r = Required rate of return.
g = Constant growth rate.
r−g>0
Therefore, this is the formula for calculating the present value of a stock using the constant
dividend growth rate. This model can help estimate the value of a stock when its future dividends
are expected to grow steadily.
Example: Valuing Equity Instruments based on Constant Dividend Growth Rate
47
© 2014-2024 AnalystPrep.Suppose a stock currently pays an annual dividend of $2.00 per share. The required rate of
return for this stock is 10%, and the dividends are expected to grow at a constant rate of 5% per
year indefinitely. Using the constant dividend growth model, the present value of this stock is
closest to:
Solution
Recall that,
D (1+ g) D
t t+1
PV = =
t
r− g r− g
In this case, we know that D =$2.00, r=10%, g=5%
t
So,
2× 1.05 2.10
PV = = = $42
r −g 0.10− 0.05
Therefore, the present value of the stock is $42
3. Valuing Equity Instruments with Changing Dividend Growth Rates is a dynamic
process. It begins with the investor buying a stock at an initial price and getting an initial
dividend. The unique aspect is that the dividend is expected to grow at a rate that evolves as the
company matures and shifts from high growth to slower growth. This valuation doesn't have a
single formula because it relies on assumptions about future dividend growth. However, a
common method is to use a multi-stage dividend discount model. This model assumes that
dividends will grow at different rates during various stages of the company's growth. To find the
stock's present value, you sum up the present values of dividends at each stage.
The Multi-Stage Dividend Discount Model builds on the Constant Dividend Growth Model. It
accommodates a company's transition from high initial growth to lower, more stable growth.
Let's say a company has a high short-term growth rate g followed by a perpetual lower growth
s
rate g. To find the present value (PV) of the stock at time t using this model, we compute it in

I. First Part: The first part calculates the present value of dividends during the initial n
periods of higher growth (g ). This is done by discounting the dividends for each period

PV =∑
t (1+r)i
i=1
Where:PV = Present value.n = Number of periods.D = Dividend at time (t).g = Initial

II. Second Part: The second part calculates the present value of dividends after the initial n
periods, assuming constant growth at a lower long-term rate (g). This can be simplified

PV = t

Example: Valuing Equity Instruments based on Changing Dividend Growth Rate
Assuming we have a stock with an expected dividend payment of $2 in one period. The discount
rate is 10%. The stock is expected to have a high dividend growth rate of 20% for the first three
years, followed by a slower growth rate of 5% thereafter. Calculate the present value of the
stock.
Solution
First, we calculate the present value of the dividends during the high growth period:
Recall that,
n D (1+ g )i
t s
PV = ∑

PV = 1.818+ 1.983+ 2.163= 5.965
1
PV = $5.97

Next, we calculate the present value of the dividends during the slower growth period, assuming
that dividends will grow at a constant rate of 5% thereafter:
Recall that,

Five years ago, Milton Inc. issued corporate bonds with a 15-year maturity. The bonds
have a semi-annual coupon rate of 7.8% per annum, and the current yield to maturity
is 8.5% per annum. The current price of Milton Inc's bonds (per CAD100 of par value)
is closest to:
A. CAD91.23.
B. CAD95.35.
C. CAD96.15.
The correct answer is B.
Solution
Recall the formula for calculating the price of a bond:
PMT PMT (PMT N +FV N )
PV(Coupon Bond) = + +...+
(1+r)1 (1+r)2 (1+r)N
First, let's get the semi-annual equivalent rates:
7.8%
The semi-annual coupon rate is =3.9%.
2
8.5%
The semi-annual yield to maturity is =4.25%.
2
Next, we find the number of periods remaining until the bond matures:
Since the bonds were issued 5 years ago and have a 15-year maturity, 10(=15−5)
years remain to maturity. Since interest is paid semi-annually, this equates to
10×2=20 periods.
You can plug the above values into the general formula, consuming valuable time.

instruments and the required return and implied growth of equity
instruments given the present value (PV) and cash flows
Implied Return for Fixed-Income Instruments
The growth rate is the rate at which the market expects an asset to grow. On the other hand,
implied return reflects a return based on the current price and future security cash flows.
Consider a fixed-income instrument. If we have its present value and assume all future cash
flows happen as expected, the discount rate rrr, or yield-to-maturity (YTM), shows the implied
return under these assumptions for the cash flow pattern.
Now, take an equity investment. If we have the present value, future value, and discount rate, we
can find the implied growth rate that aligns with these values.
The implied return or growth rate provides a view of the market expectations incorporated into
an asset's market price. It is useful for investors to understand these expectations when making
investment decisions.
Calculating the Implied Return for Fixed-Income Instruments
Discount Bond
In the case of a discount bond or instrument, recall that an investor receives a single principal
cash flow (FV) at maturity, with (FV −PV) representing the implied return.
To solve for the implied return earned over the life of an instrument (N periods), we can
rearrange the single cash flow present value formula.
Recall that the single cash flow present value formula is:
PV =FV(1+r)−t
t
53
© 2014-2024 AnalystPrep.Where:
FV = Future value.
PV = Present value.
r = Stated discount rate per period.
t = Number of compounding periods.
To solve for r, we can rearrange this formula as follows:
1
r=√t FV t −1=( FV t) t −1
PV PV
We use this formula to calculate the periodic return earned during the life of the instrument (t
periods) based on the present value (or price) and future value of the instrument.
Example: Calculating the Implied Return for a Discount Bond
Consider a zero-coupon bond with price of $900, a future value of $1,000, and a maturity of 5
years. Calculate the implied annualized return r.

This means that an investor who purchases this zero-coupon bond at a price of $900 and holds it
for five years would earn an annualized return of 2.13%.

Recall that fixed-income instruments that pay periodic interest have cash flows throughout their
life until maturity. The yield-to-maturity (YTM) is a single implied market discount rate for all
cash flows, regardless of timing. It assumes an investor expects to receive all promised cash
flows through maturity and reinvest any cash received at the same YTM.
The present value of a fixed-income instrument with periodic interest can be calculated using the
following formula:
PV = PMT 1 + PMT 2 +⋯+ (PMT N +FV N )
(1+r)1 (1+r)2 (1+r)N
Where:
PV = Present value (or price) of the instrument.
PMT = Periodic payment.
FV = Bond's principal.
N = Number of periods to maturity.
r = Discount rate (or internal rate of return) (YTM).
Example: Implied Return for Fixed-income Instruments With Periodic Interest
Consider a five-year corporate bond issued in 2023 with a 4.00 percent annual coupon and a
price of USD110.00 per USD100 principal three years later. If Milka can reinvest periodic
interest at the original YTM of 4.00 percent, the implied three-year return is closest to:
Solution
We can calculate the future value (FV) after three years, including the future price of 110.00 and
all cash flows reinvested to that date:
FV =PMT (1+r)2+PMT (1+r)+PMT +PV
3 1 2 3 3
=4×(1.04)2+4×(1.04)+4+110.00
=$122.49
55
© 2014-2024 AnalystPrep.We can then solve for Milka's annualized return r using the formula for implied return since we
have PV=100, FV=122.49, N= 3 as follows:
FV 122.49
r= √t t −1= √3 −1=3.65%
PV 110
This means that Milka, who purchased the corporate bond at a price of 100 and held it for three
years, would earn an annualized return of 3.65%.
Example: Calculating the Yield-to-Maturity of a Coupon Bond
CityGroup Corp. issued a corporate bond 7 years ago with a face value of $1,000 and a 20-year
maturity. The bond pays annual interest at a coupon rate of 6%. Currently, the bond is trading at
$1,120. The yield to maturity (YTM) of CityGroup Corp.'s bond is closest to:

Implied Return and Growth for Equity Instruments
The value of a stock is determined by both the expected return and the growth of its cash flows.
56
© 2014-2024 AnalystPrep.By assuming a constant growth rate for dividends, we can use the formula for the present value
of an equity investment to calculate the stock's implied return or growth rate.
Implied Return
Recall that the present value of a stock for constant growth of dividends is given by:
D (1+g) D
PV =
t
=
t+1
t r−g r−g
Where:
PV = Present value at time t.
t
D = Expected Dividend in the next period.
t
r = Required rate of return.
g = Constant growth rate.
r−g>0
Therefore, we can calculate the implied return on a stock given its expected dividend yield and
implied growth by rearranging the above formula as follows:
D (1+g) D
r =
t
+g=
t+1
+g
PV PV
t t
In simple terms, if we assume a stock's dividends will grow at a steady rate forever, the implied
return is the combination of its expected dividend yield and the constant growth rate.
Example: Implied Return and Growth
Suppose Apple Inc. stock is trading at a share price of USD150.00, and its annualized expected
dividend per share during the next year is USD2.00.
Moh, an analyst, projects that Apple's dividend per share will increase at a constant rate of 5%
per year indefinitely. The required return expected by investors on the stock is closest to:

In this case, D=$2.00, PV=$150, g=5%
Therefore,

Implied Growth
We can also solve for a stock's implied growth rate, which is given by the following formula:
r×PV −D r−D

Example: Calculating the Implied
Consider the previous example. Suppose Moh believes that Apple stock investors should expect a

Price-to-Earnings Ratio
58
© 2014-2024 AnalystPrep.In equity instruments, it is common practice to compare the price-to-earnings ratio.
The price-to-earnings (P/E) ratio is a valuation metric that compares the current share price
of a stock to its earnings per share. Investors and analysts use it to determine the relative value
of a company’s shares compared to other companies or the market.
A stock with a higher price-to-earnings ratio is more expensive than a lower one, as investors are
willing to pay more for each unit of earnings. This ratio is also a valuation metric for stock
indexes, such as S&P 500.
Relating P/E Ratio to Expected Future Cash Flows
The P/E ratio can relate to our earlier discussion on a stock's price (PV) to the expected future
cash flow relationship. Recall the following equation:
D ×(1+g)
t
PV =
t r−g
By dividing both sides of the equation by E , which represents earnings per share for period t, we
t
get the following equation:
D
t ×(1−g)
PV t

Where:
PVt

r = Required rate of return.
The dividend payout ratio represents the percentage of a company's earnings paid out to
shareholders in the form of dividends.
59
© 2014-2024 AnalystPrep.Typically, the forward P/E ratio, which is based on a projection of a company's earnings per
share for the next period (t +1), is used. This ratio is positively correlated with higher expected
dividend payouts and growth rates but negatively correlated with the required return.
Therefore, the equation:
Dt
×(1−g)
PV t = E t

Can be simplified as below to find the forward P/E ratio:
D t+1
PV t = Et+1 = D t+1 × 1

Example: Solving for Implied Dividend Growth Rate
Suppose a company has a forward P/E ratio of 15, a dividend payout ratio of 40%, and a required
return of 10%. The implied dividend growth rate for this company is closest to:
Solution:
First, we can use the formula for the forward P/E ratio to solve for the implied dividend growth
rate:
PV D 1
t = t+1 ×

Therefore, the implied dividend growth rate for this company is 7.33%
Example: Solving for Required Return
Let's assume you are not given the required rate of return in the question above so that the
company has a forward P/E ratio of 15, a dividend payout ratio of 40%, and an implied dividend
growth rate of 7.33%. What is the required return for this company?
Solution
Recall the formula for the forward P/E ratio to solve for the required return:
PV D 1
t = t+1 ×

no-arbitrage condition, and its use in calculating implied forward
interest rates, forward exchange rates, and option values
A timeline is a physical illustration of the amounts and timing of cashflows associated with an
investment project. For cashflows that are regular and of equal amounts, the standard annuity
formula or the financial calculator can be used. However, a timeline is preferred for irregular,
unequal, or both cashflows.
Remember that the general formula that relates the present value and the future value of an
investment is given by:
FV =PV(1+r)N
N
Where:
PV = Present value of the investment.
FV = Future value of the investment N periods from today.
N
r = Rate of interest per period.
We can represent this in a timeline:
64
© 2014-2024 AnalystPrep.In a particular timeline, a time index, t, represents a particular point in time, a specified number
of periods from today. Therefore, the present value is the investment amount today (t = 0), and
by using this amount, we can calculate the future value (t = N). Alternatively, we can use the
future value to calculate the present value.
The above argument can be written in terms of the present value. That is:
PV =FV
N
(1+r)−N
Example: Applying a Timeline to Model Cashflows
A fixed-income investor receives a series of payments, each amounting to $6,500, set to be
received in perpetuity. Payments are to be made at the end of each year, starting at the end of
year 4. If the discount rate is 9%, then what is the present value of the perpetuity at t = 0?
Solution
We would then draw a timeline to understand the problem better:
65
© 2014-2024 AnalystPrep.Here, we can see that the investor is receiving $6,500 in perpetuity. Recall that the PV of
aperpetuity is given by:
C
PV of a perpetuity =
r
So, in this case:
$6,500
PV = =$72,222
3
9%
This is the value of the perpetuity at t = 3, so we need to discount it for three more periods to
get the value at t = 0. Using the formula:
PV =FV (1+r)−N
0 N
The PV at time zero is
$72,222
=$55,769
(1+0.09)3
Why is the Use of a Timeline Recommended?
There are many instances in real life when cashflows are uneven. A good example is a pension
66
© 2014-2024 AnalystPrep.contribution that varies with age. Applying one of the basic time value formulae is impossible in
such cases. You are advised to draw a timeline even if the question appears relatively
straightforward. It will help you understand the question structure better. A timeline also helps
candidates add cashflows indexed to the same period and apply the value additivity principle.
Cashflow Additivity Principle
According to the cashflow additivity principle, the present value of any stream of cashflows
indexed at the same point equals the sum of the present values of the cashflows. This principle
has different applications in time value of money problems. Besides, this principle can be applied
to in different economic scenarios.
Application of Cashflow Additivity
Investing in Different Currencies
The principle of cash flow additivity can be applied to scenarios involving different currencies by
converting all cash flows to a common currency using the appropriate exchange rates. Doing so
allows us to compare and combine cash flows from different currencies and make investment
decisions based on their combined value.
For example, suppose we have two investment opportunities, one in US dollars and one in
Japanese yen. In that case, we can convert the expected cash flows from the Japanese yen
investment into US dollars using the appropriate exchange rates. Then, we can compare the
combined value of the two investments and decide based on their relative values.
Dealing with different currencies assumes continuous compounding. Recall that the present
value of a continuous compounding is given by:
PV =FV e−Nrs
N
Example: Applying the Cash Flow Additivity Principle
Consider an investor with USD 2,000 who wants to invest it for three months. The investor can
67
© 2014-2024 AnalystPrep.choose between two options: investing in the US government debt or German government debt.
Option 1: Investing in US Government Debt
The investor can invest his USD 2,000 in a three-month US Treasury bill. This means that he
lends the government USD 2,000, and it promises to pay him back with interest in three months.
The interest is 3%, so after three months, he will receive:
Recall that,
3
FV =2,000×e0.03× 12 =USD 2,015
Option 2: Investing in German Government Debt
The investor chooses to invest in German government debt. To do this, the investor must convert
his USD 2,000 into Euros at the current exchange of EUR/USD = 0.92 (1 USD =0.92EUR). This
means that the investor will receive (2,000×0.92) =EUR 1840. He can then lend this money to
the German government by investing in a three-month German Treasury bill. Assuming the
interest rate is 0.06 percent, after three months, the investor will receive:
FV =EUR 1840×e
0.06×
1
3
2
=EUR 1,867.81
Assuming the investor wants his money in US dollars, we need to convert the EUR1867.81 back
into USD at the forward exchange rate of USD/EUR = 1.0788. This means that the investor will
receive:
EUR 1,867.81×USD 1.07
=
88
$2,014.99 ≈2,015
1 EUR
Both options give you the same amount of money after three months: USD 2,015. The difference
is that one option involves investing in US dollars, and the other involves converting your money
into Euros and back into US dollars.
The forward exchange rate of 1.0788 USD/EUR is important because it determines how much
money you, the investor, will receive when converting your Euros back into US dollars. If this
rate differs from 1.0788, there would be an arbitrage opportunity in converting Euros to dollars.
68
© 2014-2024 AnalystPrep.More on foreign exchange rates will be discussed later in the curriculum.
Implied Forward Rates
Consider two zero-coupon bonds. Bond A has a maturity of two years and a yield of 2% per
annum, while bond B has a maturity of four years and a yield of 3%. An investor, who doesn't
seek to take advantage of price differences and is risk-neutral, has $1,000 to invest. The investor
has two investment options that earn the same return.
Option 1: The investor can put their money into bond B now, which has an annual yield of 3%,
and will pay out at the end of the four years. The Future Value (FV) of this investment in four
years, using the formula for compound interest, is:
FV =PV (1+r )4=1000(1.03)4 =1,125.51
4 0 4
Option 2: Alternatively, the investor can initially invest in bond A and, after two years, reinvest
the proceeds at a forward rate F which represents a two-year forward rate starting in year
2,2
two.
By the principle of cash flow additivity, a risk-neutral investor will not prefer one option over the
other - they are indifferent between Options 1 and 2. This is because the Future Values of both
investments at the end of four years should be the same:
FV =PV (1+r )4= PV (1+r )(1+F )
4 0 4 0 2 2,2
In this scenario, this simplifies to:
1,125.51= 1,000(1.02)2(1+F )
2,2
Solving this equation for the forward rate gives:
1,125.51
⇒F = −1= 8.18%
2,2 1,000(1.02)2
Therefore, to prevent arbitrage opportunities, the forward rate F should be set to 8.18%. This

Cashflow Additivity and Option Pricing
Cash flow additivity can be used to determine the fair price of an option contract. An option
contract gives the buyer the right, but not the obligation, to buy (call) or sell (put) an underlying
asset at a specified price within a certain period.
Cash flow additivity allows investors to compare different strategies and determine a no-
arbitrage price for a financial instrument.
Example: Illustrating Cashflow Additivity in Call Option
Consider a stock that costs $100 now. Its price might increase by 30% to $130 or decrease by
15% to $85 in one year.
Let's say an investor wants to sell a call on the stock that gives the buyer the right, but not the
obligation, to purchase the asset for $120. The principle of cash flow additivity can be used to
70
© 2014-2024 AnalystPrep.determine the contract's no-arbitrage price.
If the stock price goes up, the contract is worth cu =10. That's because the buyer can use the
1
contract to buy the asset for $120 and then sell it for $130, making a profit of $10. But if the
price goes down, the contract is worth nothing. The buyer wouldn't want to use the contract to
buy the asset for $120 when they could just buy it for $85 without the contract.
The underlying argument here is that the value of the option is each movement of the stock
option may be used to construct a risk-free portfolio (the value of the portfolio is the same in
both scenarios).
Denote the initial value of the call option by c , which we wish to determine using cash flow
0
additivity and no-arbitrage pricing. Also, denote the value of the portfolio at t =0 by V 0 , when
the stock price increases by Vu and when the stock price decreases by Vd
1 1
Assume that at t =0 creates a risk-free portfolio by selling a call option at c 0 and buying 0.22
units of underlying assets. Then, the value of the portfolio at inception is:
V
0
=0.22×100−c
0
This portfolio is called a replicating portfolio because it is designed to create a matching
future cash flow stream to that of a risk-free asset.
Similarly, in each scenario of stock price decrease and increase:
V u=0.22×130−10 =18.89
1
V d=0.22×85−0=18.89
1
Intuitively, the value replicating portfolio equals 18.89, whether the stock prices rise or decline.
As such, the replicating portfolio is risk-free and can be discounted as a risk-free asset. Assuming
that risk-free rate is r = 2.5%, then:
V =V u(1+r)−1 =Vd(1+r)−1
0 1 1
=18.89(1.025)−1 =18.43
At this point, we can calculate the value of c rearranging the initial portfolio value equation:

0
=0.22×100−c
0
⇒18.43 =0.22×100−c

∴c
0
=3.57
As such, the fair price of the call option is $3.57, which the seller expects to receive from the
buyer.

The current USD/CHF exchange rate is 0.9. The risk-free interest rates for one year
are 2% for the US dollar and 1% for the Swiss franc. Which of the following one-year
USD/CHF forward rates would best prevent arbitrage opportunities?
A. USD/CHF 0.909.
B. USD/CHF 0.099.
C. USD/CHF 0.891.
Solution
The correct Answer is A.
Dealing with different currencies assumes continuous compounding. Recall that the
future value of a continuous compounding is given by:
FV =PV
N
eNrs
So,
In one year, a single unit of Swiss franc invested is:
e0.01 =CHF 1.0101
In one year, a single unit of Swiss Franc converted to US dollars and then invested
risk-free is worth;
0.9e0.02 =USD 0.9182
Therefore, to convert USD 0.9182 into CHF 1.0101 requires a forward exchange rate
of:
0.9182
=USD/CHF 0.909
1.0101
