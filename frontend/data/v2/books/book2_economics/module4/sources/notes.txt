Learning Module 4: Monetary Policy
LOS 4a: describe the roles and objectives of central banks
Objectives of Central Banks
The main objective of a central bank is to maintain price stability. Depending on the country,
central banks might have other objectives, such as controlling inflation, unemployment, interest
rates, or exchange rates. However, all these objectives align with the primary objective of
ensuring financial stability.
Roles of Central Banks
Central banks are crucial in today's economies, performing various vital functions for
maintaining economic stability and promoting growth. The following are the different roles of
central banks, explained based on the provided information:
Monopoly Supplier of the Currency
Central banks are the exclusive institutions authorized by law to supply domestic currency,
replacing the earlier system where money was exchanged for precious commodities like gold by
many private banks.
Money in all major economies today is known as fiat money, which implies that it is not
convertible into any other commodity. Moreover, it is deemed as legal tender, which means it
must be accepted for goods, services, and debt repayment.
Central banks play a vital role as the suppliers and protectors of the value of fiat currencies,
thereby maintaining confidence in the currency and preventing its arbitrary expansion.
Banker to the Government and the Bankers' Bank
Central banks serve as the principal bankers to the government and other banks, ensuring they
89
© 2014-2024 AnalystPrep.have the necessary liquidity to operate smoothly. This role is particularly crucial during crises
when banks may face liquidity challenges. Being able to print money places central banks in a
unique position to supply funds to banks in crisis, thereby preventing bank runs and maintaining
stability in the financial system.
Lender of Last Resort
Central banks act as the ultimate source of funds for banks facing a liquidity crisis. The
knowledge that the central bank stands ready to provide the required liquidity and the trust in
government bank deposit insurance helps prevent bank runs. However, as observed in recent
financial crises, this central bank's role alone may not always be sufficient to avert a bank run.
Regulator and Supervisor of the Payments System
Central banks often oversee, regulate, and establish standards for a country's payment system to
ensure its robustness and standardization. This role includes overseeing the payments system,
introducing new processes, and coordinating payment systems internationally with other central
banks.
Supervisor of the Banking System
Many central banks supervise the banking system or at least the banks they license to accept
deposits. This role may vary from country to country, with some central banks sharing this
responsibility with another authority.
Manager of Foreign Currency and Gold Reserves
Even though the gold standard was abandoned in the early twentieth century, central banks still
hold substantial quantities of gold and foreign currency reserves. Decisions by central banks to
sell significant portions of their gold reserves could potentially affect gold prices.
Conductor of Monetary Policy
90
© 2014-2024 AnalystPrep.This is arguably the most important role of central banks. Central banks are perfectly situated to
formulate and execute monetary policy by being the exclusive issuer of the national currency.
91
© 2014-2024 AnalystPrep.Question
Credit control refers to actions undertaken by central banks to:
A. Control inflation.
B. Control imports and exports.
C. Control the money creation of the government.
Solution
The correct answer is A.
The central bank controls the credit creation process by commercial banks to control
inflationary and deflationary pressures on the economy.
92
© 2014-2024 AnalystPrep.LOS 4b: describe tools used to implement monetary policy tools and the
monetary transmission mechanism, and explain the relationships
between monetary policy and economic growth, inflation, interest, and
exchange rates
Central banks implement the monetary policy using a number of instruments. These affect the
aggregate demand through the supply of money, cost of money, and credit availability. The three
main tools central banks use to implement monetary policies are open market operations, the
central bank's policy rate, and reserve requirements.
Open Market Operations
Open market operations refer to cases where a central bank buys and sells government bonds
from and to commercial banks or designated market markers. For instance, when the central
bank sells government bonds, the commercial bank's reserves are decreased, and, therefore,
they cannot be in a position to lend more to corporations and households. This leads to a decline
in broad money growth through the money multiplier effect.
On the other hand, when recessionary forces get going in an economy, the central bank
purchases government bonds, increasing the commercial banks' reserves. Commercial banks
then tend to lend more to households and corporations, who, in turn, invest more. In this way,
broad money growth expands through the money multiplier mechanism.
Clearly, the central bank uses open market operations to set appropriate levels of commercial
bank reserves or interest rates for the reserves.
The Central Bank's Policy Rate
The policy rate, often referred to by various names depending on the central bank, is a primary
tool that central banks use to convey their monetary policy intentions. Its main purpose is to
influence both short-term and long-term interest rates, affecting real economic activity.
Generally, the policy rate is the interest rate at which the central bank lends money to
commercial banks.
93
© 2014-2024 AnalystPrep.A common mechanism for this is through repurchase agreements (repos), whose maturity ranges
from overnight to two weeks. For instance, if the central bank wishes to increase money supply
in the economy, it buys government bonds with an agreement to resell them in the future,
effectively lending money to banks.
In essence, a repurchase agreement is a form of a loan to commercial banks, and the central
bank (lender) earns a repo rate.
When a central bank raises its policy rate, commercial banks typically raise their base rates in
response. The base rate of a commercial bank is a benchmark for its lending rates to various
customers. Banks adjust their rates based on the central bank's rate to avoid lending at rates
lower than what the central bank charges them.
As such, when the policy rate rises, it becomes costlier for commercial banks to borrow. This
typically leads them to decrease their lending activities, reducing the money supply.
On the other hand, a reduction in the policy rate makes borrowing cheaper for commercial
banks. This often prompts them to increase their lending, consequently boosting the money
supply.
Note that the central bank can compel commercial banks to take loans from it at a specific rate.
This is made possible through its open market operations, which can deliberately induce a money
deficit. Consequently, banks are nudged into selling bonds back to the central bank under the
repurchase agreement. The repo rate is set in a way that ensures the central bank receives the
standard refinancing rate from these deals.
In essence, by adjusting the policy rate, central banks can control the amount of money
circulating in the market. A higher policy rate makes borrowing from the central bank costlier,
potentially leading to reduced lending and slowed money growth in the broader economy.
Reserve Requirements
The law requires commercial banks to keep a certain percentage of their total deposits in the
central bank as a reserve. When prices rise, the central bank raises the reserve ratios, and,
therefore, commercial banks are left with less money to lend to the business community.
94
© 2014-2024 AnalystPrep.Consequently, the volume of output, employment, and investment are adversely affected.
Eventually, prices will fall.
The opposite is also true. Note that the higher the reserve requirement, the less money
commercial banks can create. Hence, if the central bank wants to reduce the money creation
power of commercial banks, it could easily increase the commercial bank's reserve
requirements.
Setting reserve requirements as a monetary policy is not commonly used in developed market
economies. Varying reserve requirements are disruptive to the banks because a sudden increase
can halt a bank's lending if it lacks sufficient reserves.
However, central banks in emerging economies still use reserve requirements to manage
lending.
The Monetary Transmission Mechanism
The monetary transmission mechanism is the process where a central bank's interest rate is
transmitted through the economy and ultimately affects the rate of increase of prices (inflation).
Consider a situation where a central bank increases its official interest rate. The implementation
of the policy may be reflected on four connected channels: bank lending rates, asset prices,
agents' expectations or confidence and exchange rates.
Bank Lending Rates
When the central bank increases its official rate, commercial banks usually respond by
increasing their base and interbank rates. This, in turn, amplifies the borrowing costs for both
individuals and corporations across various time horizons. With heightened interest rates, there
is a general trend among businesses and consumers to limit their borrowing activities.
Asset Prices
Higher short-term interest rates can lead to an increased discount rate for estimating future
95
© 2014-2024 AnalystPrep.cash flows. Consequently, assets like bonds and the projected value of capital initiatives might
witness a dip in their prices.
Agents' Expectations/ Confidence
Market players might interpret elevated interest rates as a precursor to slower economic
progress, diminished profits, and a contraction in asset-financing borrowings. The anticipation
and interpretation of future interest rate trends can have a significant influence on economic
decisions. If the market perceives the central bank's move as the beginning of a series of rate
hikes, this could lead to reduced consumption, borrowing, and a slump in asset prices.
Exchange rates
Increase in interest rates might make a country's exchange rate to appreciate. This appreciation
can make domestically produced goods expensive for international buyers, potentially reducing
exporters' earnings. This could further dampen the demand for local exports.
Overally, an increase in the central bank's policy rate may lead to a decrease in both domestic
demand and net external demand (export consumption less import consumption), which can be
decreased by an increase in the central bank's policy rate.
A weaker total demand would tend to push domestic inflation rates downward, as would a
stronger currency, which would drive down the cost of imports. When these elements are
considered collectively, the overall measure of inflation may start to experience negative
pressure.
A monetary transmission can be represented in the following diagram:
96

© 2014-2024 AnalystPrep.Question
Which of the following elements is least likely to be a component of the monetary
transmission mechanism?
A. Setting an inflation rate target.
B. Implementing a transfer payment program.
C. Adjusting the central bank's official interest rate.
Solution
The correct choice is B.
Transfer payments are related to fiscal policy, not monetary policy.
A is not correct. Establishing an inflation rate target is an aspect of the monetary
transmission mechanism, typically occurring later in the process.
C is not correct. Modifying the central bank's official interest rate is usually the
initial step in the monetary transmission mechanism.
98
© 2014-2024 AnalystPrep.LOS 4c: describe qualities of effective central banks; contrast their use
of inflation, interest rate, and exchange rate targeting in expansionary or
contractionary monetary policy; and describe the limitations of monetary
policy
The central bank of any nation worldwide is responsible for managing the country's monetary
policy. They also often have the responsibility of maintaining price stability and inflation.
Central banks need to have the significant qualities highlighted below to be more effective in
their responsibilities.
Transparency
It is ideal for a central bank to be transparent in its decision-making. They do this by producing
reports and airing their views on economic indicators used to develop the monetary policy.
For instance, central banks produce inflation reports that provide insights into the various
indicators they monitor when determining their monthly interest rate adjustments. When making
their assessments, they typically address these topics in the given sequence:
Overview of broad money trends and credit conditions.
The state of financial markets.
Changes in the real economy, such as employment dynamics and
Trends in pricing.
Transparency helps central banks gain reputation and credibility, which, in turn, facilitates their
ability to shape inflation expectations and more effectively achieve their inflation target.
Independence
While governments can set inflation targets and instruct central banks on interest rates, there's
a risk. Politicians aiming for reelection might keep interest rates artificially low, potentially
leading to inflation surges. Hence, the prevailing sentiment is that monetary decisions should be
99
© 2014-2024 AnalystPrep.made by an entity distant from political agendas, positioning central banks as exclusive currency
providers.
Yet, there are degrees of independence. Government officials often select central bank leaders.
For instance, the US president appoints the US Federal Reserve Board's chair. As such, achieving
total detachment from political sway might be idealistic but challenging.
Different central banks have varying degrees of independence. Some have both operational and
target independence, meaning they decide interest rates, define and set the inflation rate, and
choose the timeframe to meet the target. The ECB is a prime example. In contrast, others, like
those in New Zealand, Sweden, and the UK, are bound by government-set inflation standards
and targets, granting them only operational autonomy.
Credibility
A central bank is a national institution granted the prerogative to control the printing and supply
of money and credit. Central banks play important roles in the economy since they are the sole
suppliers of currency to the government, bankers to commercial banks, lenders of last resort,
supervisors of payment systems, and implementers of monetary policy.
For a central bank's measures to resonate and be effective, the public's trust is paramount. In an
era where inflation-targeting is crucial, the credibility of a central bank isn't just about the
policies they enact but about the public's unwavering confidence in those policies. Especially
during volatile times, a central bank's credibility ensures stability and instills faith in the
financial future.
Inflation and Exchange Rate Targeting
Inflation Rate Targeting
The inception of this now widely accepted inflation-targeting approach can be traced back to
New Zealand. In 1988, Roger Douglas, the New Zealand Finance Minister of the time, put forth a
transformative economic policy. The country aimed to curtail inflation, which stood at
100
© 2014-2024 AnalystPrep.approximately 6%, bringing it within a more controlled range of 0 to 2%.
This inflationary target could be a benchmark. When this is the case, other policies are
implemented to ensure that the inflation rate within the economy does not grow beyond the
targeted inflation rate within a given period of time.
Regardless of who sets the target, either the central bank or the government, the specific target
level and the timeframe within which it should be achieved are vital elements in every inflation-
targeting approach. For instance, in the UK, the Bank of England's target is CPI inflation within
±1.0 percentage point of 2%.
While inflation-targeting strategies might differ slightly across different economies, their
effectiveness is widely believed to hinge on three qualities of a central bank: independence,
credibility, and transparency.
The inflation target cannot be set at 0% because it might lead to deflation, which is negative
inflation. Moreover, inflation targeters do not aim at the current inflation but usually inflation
two years ahead for two main reasons:
i. The monthly headline inflation rate, targeted by central banks in many economies,
represents the yearly increase in the cost of a basket of goods and services. Essentially, it
reflects past price changes.
ii. Changes in interest rates today will require time to fully impact the real economy due to
the gradual process of the monetary transmission mechanism.
While the specifics of inflation-targeting mandates differ across nations, they generally include a
clear inflation target within set boundaries and require transparency from the central bank in its
goals and actions. Typically, these guidelines are established in laws that set formal duties for
the central bank.
Exceptions in Inflation Targeting
The two central banks that do not adopt inflation-rate targeting are the Bank of Japan and the
US Federal Reserve System.
101
© 2014-2024 AnalystPrep.Japan's central bank, the BoJ, does not target an explicit measure of inflation because Japan has
been battling deflation for nearly two decades. Despite measures taken, including printing
money, inflation has remained weak. Inflation targeting is primarily seen as a method to combat
and control inflation, making it seemingly irrelevant in an economy consistently facing deflation.
Interestingly, the US Federal Reserve does not set an explicit inflation target because a strict
focus on inflation might clash with the Federal Reserve Act's mandate: “promote effectively the
goals of maximum employment, stable prices, and moderate long-term interest rates.”
Some suggest that targeting inflation could jeopardize the objective of “maximum employment.”
However, in practical terms, the Fed views core inflation around or slightly under 2% (as
measured by the personal consumption expenditure or PCE deflator) as synonymous with “stable
prices.” Consequently, financial markets closely monitor this US inflation metric to predict the
Fed's interest rate decisions.
Exchange Rate Targeting
Many emerging economies prioritize targeting their currency's exchange rate rather than
focusing on domestic inflation. They establish a fixed or range-bound value for their currency
relative to a major global currency and stabilize it by trading in the forex market. By linking its
currency to a stable, low-inflation economy, a country can essentially “borrow” the inflation
stability of the more established economy.
Consider a scenario where a developing nation wishes to peg its currency to the US dollar.
Assuming similar inflation rates and consistent relative price levels, the currency should remain
near its targeted value if there are no unforeseen economic disruptions, effectively inheriting the
foreign nation's inflation scenario.
However, if the developing country's economy accelerates and its inflation surpasses that of the
US, its currency might devalue against the dollar. To maintain the targeted exchange rate, the
country's central bank would buy its currency and sell foreign reserves, leading to decreased
money supply and raised interest rates.
Conversely, if its inflation rate drops compared to the US, the central bank would do the
102
© 2014-2024 AnalystPrep.opposite, increasing the money supply and dropping interest rates.
In real-world scenarios, a developing country's central bank intervenes regularly to maintain the
stability of its currency value. However, an essential takeaway from this example is that when a
monetary authority aims for a specific exchange rate, the domestic economic conditions,
including interest rates and the money supply, must adjust to support this goal. As a result, these
domestic economic indicators might experience greater fluctuations and volatility.
Despite potential pitfalls, several currencies are still pegged, especially to the US dollar. Such
currencies with pegged currencies include Saudi Arabia, Bahamas, and Lebanon.
Some currencies have a “managed exchange rate policy,” fluctuating within a set range managed
by the monetary authority.
In some cases, countries even adopt the US dollar as their official currency, completely replacing
their native currency, a situation called dollarization. Such countries include Panama, Ecuador,
and East Timor.
Contractionary and Expansionary Monetary Policies.
Recall that central banks control liquidity in the economy by adjusting their benchmark interest
rates. As such, contractionary aims to reduce the money supply's growth rate and potentially
curb the economy's growth. As such, if they anticipate rising inflation due to increased economic
activity, they might increase interest rates, reducing available funds in the market.
On the other hand, when the economy slows and both inflation and monetary trends appear
weak, central banks can boost liquidity by reducing their target interest rate. This is known as an
“expansionary” monetary policy.
Neutral Rate of Interest
The terms “high” and “low” for policy rates are relative. Their point of reference is often the
“neutral rate of interest,” a rate that neither stimulates nor restrains economic growth. If the
policy rates exceed the neutral rate, the monetary policy is seen as contractionary. If they are
below the neutral rate, it's viewed as expansionary. Ideally, over an economic cycle, the neutral
103
© 2014-2024 AnalystPrep.rate should be equal to the average policy rate.
The neutral rate of interest consists of:
The real trend rate of growth of the underlying economy,
Long-run expected inflation.
The real trend rate of growth is considered as the sustainable economic growth rate that results
in stable inflation over time. If, for instance, an economy's credible inflation target is 2% annually
and its sustainable long-term growth is believed to be 1.5% annually, then the neutral rate can be
calculated as:
Neutral rate=1.5%(Trend Growth)+2%(Inflation Target) =3.5%.
Thus, a policy rate exceeding 3.5% would be considered contractionary, while one below this rate
would be seen as expansionary.
Sources of Shocks to Inflation Rate
The shock to inflation rates can be classified as demand and supply shocks.
Demand shock occurs when inflation is rising beyond its target or simply in a way that threatens
price stability due to an increase in the confidence of consumers and business leaders, which in
turn has led to increases in consumption and investment growth rates. In this case, it might be
appropriate to tighten monetary policy to bring the inflationary pressures generated by these
domestic demand pressures under control.
On the other hand, supply shock occurs when an inflation spike is due to external factors, like a
significant jump in oil prices. In this situation, already-burdened consumers dealing with high
fuel costs might reduce spending, potentially causing a decrease in profits and a rise in
unemployment.
Therefore, it is crucial for the monetary authority to accurately pinpoint the cause of inflationary
changes before deciding to either tighten or loosen monetary policy.
104
© 2014-2024 AnalystPrep.Limitations of Monetary Policy
Monetary policy is used in the stabilization of prices and inflation control. However, monetary
policy has quite a number of shortcomings and, as such, usually does not reach expectations.
These shortcomings are discussed below.
Problems in the Monetary Transmission Mechanism
Monetary policy actions are conveyed to the economy through channels like bank lending rates,
asset prices, and expectations. Sometimes, the intended effects might not permeate the economy
as expected.
For instance, raising interest rates might not always result in the desired economic slowdown if
long-term rates fall due to market expectations. Bond market vigilantes play a role in affecting
yields based on their perception of monetary policy's efficacy.
Extreme cases like a liquidity trap, where money injections no longer influence interest rates,
can render monetary policy ineffective, especially during deflation.
Interest Rate Adjustment in a Deflationary Environment and Quantitative
Easing as a Response
Deflation, a continuous fall in prices, is challenging for standard monetary policy. During
deflation, slashing interest rates near or below zero might not be effective, leading to a liquidity
trap. This can result in reduced consumer spending, further deflation, and rising real debt, as
witnessed in Japan post the 1990s property bubble collapse.
If standard policy tools fail, alternatives like quantitative easing (QE) can be utilized. QE involves
large-scale asset purchases to inject money into the economy. Though it aims to stimulate
lending and boost economic activity, its success is not guaranteed.
Central banks can buy a variety of assets under a QE program if permitted by the government.
However, buying risky assets can be dangerous. Acquiring bad assets that incur losses might
lead to a severe confidence crisis in the central bank's primary product: fiat money.
105
© 2014-2024 AnalystPrep.Monetary Policy in Developing Countries
Emerging economies often encounter notable challenges in the effective implementation of
monetary policy, particularly in achieving price stability. These challenges encompass:
a lack of a well-established government bond market and a mature interbank market,
essential for carrying out monetary policy.
a history of struggles with inflation control, which undermines the credibility of their
monetary policy objectives.
an unwillingness by governments to give true independence to their central banks.
Rapid changes in financial methodologies frequently alter the meaning of money
supply.
a constantly evolving economy, complicating the determination of the neutral interest
rate and the stable connection between the money supply and the real economy.
106
© 2014-2024 AnalystPrep.Question #1
While politicians and central banks may share certain economic goals, which
objective is politicians least likely to prioritize?
A. Promoting economic growth.
B. Boosting employment rates.
C. Addressing inflationary concerns.
Solution
The correct answer is C.
Addressing inflationary concerns is primarily the domain of central banks. Politicians,
in contrast, often prioritize boosting employment rates and promoting economic
growth.
Question #2
If a central bank raises its policy rate, how might this action alleviate inflationary
pressures?
A. By dampening consumer demand.
B. By affecting the foreign exchange value of the domestic currency.
C. By elevating asset prices leading to increased household wealth.
Solution
The correct answer is A.
When policy rates rise, borrowing becomes costlier, leading to decreased consumer
demand, which subsequently reduces inflationary pressures.
B is incorrect. A hike in the interest rate typically strengthens the domestic
currency, making imports cheaper and potentially decreasing inflationary pressures.
107
© 2014-2024 AnalystPrep.C is incorrect. Higher policy rates often depress asset prices since banks have
reduced lending to businesses and consumers, leading to decreased investment and
consumption.
Question #3
Which of the following is least likely considered a limitation of monetary policy?
A. Encountering a liquidity trap.
B. Achieving price stability.
C. Responding to bond market vigilantes.
Solution
The correct answer is B.
Achieving price stability is one of the core objectives of monetary policy, not a
limitation. Both A and C, liquidity trap and bond market vigilantes, respectively, pose
challenges to the efficacy of monetary policy.
108
© 2014-2024 AnalystPrep.LOS 4d: explain the interaction of monetary and fiscal policy
Monetary and fiscal policies are tools used to influence the broader economy. However, the
effectiveness of monetary policy on aggregate demand can vary based on the fiscal policy in
place and vice versa.
Even though both policies can influence aggregate demand, they work differently and affect its
composition in varying ways. They cannot simply replace one another.
Recall that the central bank applies monetary policy to change the cost, demand, and availability
of credit. It controls credit through open market operations, bank rates, selective methods of
credit control, and variable cash reserve ratio.
On the other hand, Fiscal policy focuses on the government in relation to taxation, borrowing,
and expenditure. These three elements mostly influence aggregate spending.
The Relationship Between Monetary and Fiscal Policy
Consider the following assumptions, assuming wages and prices remain fixed:
Easy fiscal policy/tight monetary policy
With reduced taxes or increased government spending, aggregate output will rise. However, with
reduced money supply counteracting the fiscal boost, interest rates increase, diminishing private
sector demand. As a result, there's a rise in output and interest rates, with government spending
becoming a more significant part of the national income.
Tight fiscal policy/easy monetary policy
With fiscal reductions paired with an accommodating monetary stance leading to decreased
interest rates, the private sector gets a boost and grows a share of GDP, while the public sector
diminishes.
109
© 2014-2024 AnalystPrep.Easy monetary policy/easy fiscal policy
When both fiscal and monetary stances are accommodating, the combined effect is highly
stimulative. This results in a spike in aggregate demand, potentially reduced interest rates, and
expansion of both private and public sectors.
Tight monetary policy/tight fiscal policy
Interest rates potentially increase, suppressing private demand. Simultaneously, elevated taxes
and reduced government expenditure result in decreased aggregate demand from both the
public and private sectors.
Factors Influencing the Interaction of Monetary and Fiscal
Policies
Promotion of Potential Output Growth: Governments aim to stabilize aggregate
demand near full employment and grow potential output. Encouraging private
investment can be achieved via accommodative monetary policy (low interest rates)
and tight fiscal policy to ensure resources for a growing private sector.
Infrastructure and Workforce Quality: Sometimes, the absence of quality
infrastructure or a trained workforce can hinder growth. The government may
prioritize spending in these sectors. If not balanced by increased taxes, this can lead to
an expansionary fiscal stance. Paired with a loose monetary policy, it may induce
inflation.
Political Context: Policy decisions are influenced by politics. A weak government
might increase spending to appease specific vested interests. To counteract potential
inflation, restrictive monetary policy (higher interest rates, limited credit) might be
employed.
Data Limitations: Both policies are hampered by imprecise current economic data
due to revisions and time lags. However, fiscal policy, compared to monetary policy, has
110
© 2014-2024 AnalystPrep.additional challenges. It's slower to implement and politically easier to expand than a
contract.
Monetary and Fiscal Policy Interplay: The relationship between these policies
influences decisions. For instance, if tax cuts don't impact spending because of
anticipated future taxes, policymakers might lean towards monetary tools.
Empirical Considerations: The IMF's study highlighted the interaction between
monetary and fiscal policies. They explored global fiscal loosening scenarios and how
monetary policy responded. Key findings include:
Without monetary accommodation: Government spending has a
significantly larger effect on GDP than social transfers. Targeted transfers to
the poorest have a greater effect than non-targeted ones.
With monetary accommodation: Fiscal multipliers are generally larger.
The impact of government expenditure and social transfers on GDP grows
substantially, except for labor tax cuts.
111
© 2014-2024 AnalystPrep.Question
Which one of the following will most likely have important effect on
aggregate demand?
A. Government expenditures.
B. Increased transfer benefits.
C. A reduction of personal income tax at all income levels.
Solution
The correct answer is A.
Direct spending by the government has a greater impact on GDP than taxes
and transfer benefits.
