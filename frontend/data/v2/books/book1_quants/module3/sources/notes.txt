Learning Module 3: Statistical Measures of Asset Returns
LOS 3a: calculate, interpret, and evaluate measures of central tendency
and location to address an investment problem
The center of any data is identified via a measure of central tendency. A measure of central
tendency for a series of returns reveals the center of the empirical distribution of returns. They
include mean, mode, and median.
Measures of location help us understand where data points tend to cluster. These measures
include central tendency measures such as mean, median, and mode. There are also other
measures that provide different insights into how the data is spread out or located within a
distribution.
Measures of Central Tendency
Arithmetic Mean
The arithmetic mean is the sum of the values of the observations in a dataset divided by the

Recall the formula: denoted by R¯
i
arithmetic mean for an asset i is a simple process of finding the
average holding period returns. It is given by:
R¯ i= R i,1 +R i,1 +…+R i,T−1 +R iT = 1 ∑ T R it
T T
t=1
Where:
R = Return of asset i in period t.
it
T = Total number of periods.
For example, if a share has returned 15%, 10%, 12%,
and 3% over the last four years, then the arithmetic
mean is computed as follows:
1 T 1
R¯ i= ∑ R it = (15%+10%+12%+3%) =10%
T 4
t=1
Population Mean and Sample Mean
The population mean is the summation of all the observed values in the population, ∑X divided
i
by the total number of observations, N. The population mean differs from the sample mean,
which is based on a few observed values chosen from the population. Thus:
∑X
i
Population mean =
N
∑X
i
Sample mean =
n
Analysts use the sample mean to estimate the actual population mean.
The population mean and the sample mean are both arithmetic means. The arithmetic mean for
any data set is unique and is computed using all the data values. Among all the measures of
central tendency, it is the only measure for which the sum of the deviations from the mean is
75

Example: Calculating the Arithmetic Mean
The following are the annual returns realized from a
given asset between 2005 and 2015.
{12% 13% 11.5% 14% 9.8% 17% 16.1%
13% 11% 14%}
Calculate the population mean.
Solution
0.12+0.13+0.115+0.14+0.098+0.17+0.161+0.13+0.11+0.14
Population mean=
10
= 0.1314= 13.14%
Median
The median is the statistical value located at the center of a data set organized in ascending or
descending order.
Consider a sample of n observations. For an odd-numbered of observations, the median is the
(n+1)
observation that is located in position. On the other hand, if the number of observations is
2
even, the media is the mean value of the observations located in n and n+2 position.
2 2
Unlike the arithmetic mean, the median resists the effects of extreme observations. However, it
only gives the relative position of the ranked observations without considering all observations
relating to the size of the observations.
Example: Calculating the Median
The following are the annual returns on a given asset realized between 2005 and 2015.
{12% 13% 11.5% 14% 9.8% 17% 16.1% 13% 11% 14%}
76
© 2014-2024 AnalystPrep.The median is closest to:
Solution
First, we arrange the returns in ascending order:
{9.8% 11% 11.5% 12% 13% 13% 14% 14% 16.1% 17%}
Since the number of observations is even, the median return will be the middle point of the two
middle values in the positions n and (n+2) .
2 2
The value occupying n = 10 = 5th position is 13, and the value located in (n+2) = 12 = 6th
2 5 2 2
position is 13, so that the mode is:
13%+13%
=13%
2
Mode
The mode is the value that appears most often in a dataset. Sometimes, a dataset has a mode;
sometimes, it doesn't. If all the observations in a dataset are different and no value repeats more
than others, then the dataset has no mode.
A dataset with one mode is called unimodal. When there are two modes, it's called bimodal. If the
distribution has three frequently occurring values, it's termed trimodal.
An interval with the highest frequency is called the modal interval (or intervals) in a frequency
distribution. For instance, in the frequency distribution below, the modal interval is -1.0 to 0.0
with an absolute frequency of 520.

2.0 to 3.0 3 0.24 1,249 99.92
3.0 to 4.0 1 0.08 1,250 100.00
In a histogram, the modal interval always has the highest bar.
The mode is the only measure of central tendency that can be used with nominal data. Nominal
data refers to a type of data that is categorized into distinct categories or groups without any
inherent order or numerical value. Examples of nominal data include gender (male, female), eye
color (blue, brown, green), and marital status (single, married, divorced).
Example: Calculating the Mode
78
© 2014-2024 AnalystPrep.Determine the mode from the following data set:
{20% 23% 20% 16% 21% 20% 16% 23% 25% 27% 20%}
Solution
The mode is 20%. It occurs four times, a frequency higher than any other value in the data set.
Clearly, this dataset is unimodal.
Dealing With Outliers
An outlier may represent a distinct value in a population. In addition, it may show that there was
an error in recording the value, or it was generated from a different population.
When working with a sample with outliers, we can potentially transform the variable or choose
another variable that achieves the same objective. If these observations prove to be impossible,
there are three options:
Option 1: Take no action and use the data as it is. If these observations are accurate, then this is
appropriate.
Option 2: Remove outliers using the trimmed mean. For example, when calculating the central
tendency, a 4 percent trimmed mean excludes the lowest 2% and highest 2% of values.
Option 3: Substitute a different value for the outliers. The winsorized mean is an illustration of a
central tendency that does this. For instance, when computing a 96% winsorized mean, the value
at or above the lowest and highest 2% is assigned the lowest and highest 2% values.
Measures of Location
Quartiles, quintiles, deciles, and percentiles are values or cut points that partition a finite
number of observations into nearly equal-sized subsets. The number of partitions depends on the
type of cut point involved.
79
© 2014-2024 AnalystPrep.Quartiles
They divide data into four parts. The first quartile, Q , is referred to as the lower quartile, and
1
the last quartile, Q is the upper quartile. Q splits the data into the lower 25% and upper 75%
4, 1
values. Similarly, the upper quartile subdivides the data into the lower 75% of the values and the
upper 25%. The difference between the upper and lower quartiles is known as the interquartile
range, which indicates the spread of the middle 50% of the data.
Quintiles
Though rarely used in practice, quintiles split a set of data into five equal parts, i.e., fifths.
Therefore, the second quintile splits data into the lower 40% of the values and the upper 60%.
Deciles
The deciles subdivide data into ten equal parts. There are 10 deciles in any data set. For
example, the fourth decile splits data into the lower 40% of the values and the upper 60%.
Percentiles
Percentiles split data into 100 equal parts, i.e., hundredths. So, for instance, the 77th percentile
splits the data into the lower 77% of the values and the upper 23%.
Financial analysts commonly use the four types of subdivisions to rank investment performance.
You should note that quartiles, quintiles, and deciles can all be expressed as percentiles. For
instance, the first quartile is just the 25th percentile. Similarly, the fourth decile is simply the
40th percentile. This enables the application of the formula below.
(n+1)y
Position of percentile =
100
Example: Calculating Quartiles
Given the following distribution of returns, calculate the lower quartile.
80
© 2014-2024 AnalystPrep.{10% 23% 12% 21% 14% 17% 16% 11% 15% 19%}
Solution
First, we have to arrange the values in ascending order:
{10% 11% 12% 14% 15% 16% 17% 19% 21% 23%}
Next, we establish the position of the first quartile. This is simply the 25th percentile. Therefore:
(10+1)25
P 25 = =2.75th value
100
Since the value is not straightforward, we have to extrapolate between the 2nd and the 3rd data
points. The 25th percentile is three-fourths (0.75) of the way from the 2nd data point (11%) to the
3rd data point (12%):
11%+0.75×(12−11) =11.75%
Box and Whisker Plot
Box and whisker plot is used to display the dispersion of data across quartiles. A box and whisker
plot consists of a "box" with "whiskers" connected to the box. It shows the following five-number
summary of a set of data.

Quantiles have two main purposes in investment practice. First, quantiles are used to rank
performance. Secondly, quantiles can be used in investment research for comparison purposes.
For example, companies can be clustered into deciles to compare the performance of small
companies with the large ones. In this case, the first decile will contain the portfolio of
companies with the smallest market values, while the tenth decile will contain the companies
with the largest market values.

A mutual fund achieved the following rates of growth over an 11-month period:
{3% 2% 7% 8% 2% 4% 3% 7.5% 7.2% 2.7% 2.09%}
The 5th decile from the data is closest to:
A. 2%.
B. 3%.
C. 4%.
Solution
The correct answer is B.
First, you should re-arrange the data in ascending order:
{2% 2% 2.09% 2.7% 3% 3% 4% 7% 7.2% 7.5% 8%}
Secondly, you should establish the 5th decile. This is simply the 50th percentile and is
actually the median:
(1+11)50
P =
50 100
=12×0.5
=6, i.e., the 6th data point
Therefore, the 5th decile = 50th percentile = Median = 3%

© 2014-2024 AnalystPrep.LOS 3b: calculate, interpret, and evaluate measures of dispersion to
address an investment problem
Measures of dispersion are used to describe the variability or spread in a sample or population.
They are usually used in conjunction with measures of central tendency, such as the mean and
the median. Specifically, measures of dispersion are the range, variance, absolute deviation, and
standard deviation.
Measures of dispersion are essential because they give us an idea of how well the measures of
central tendency represent the data. For example, if the standard deviation is large, then there
are large differences between individual data points. Consequently, the mean may not be
representative of the data.
Range
The range is the difference between the highest and the lowest values in a dataset, i.e.,
Range = Maximum value - Minimum value
Example: Calculating the Range
Consider the following scores of 10 level I candidates:
{78 56 67 51 43 89 57 67 78 50}
Range =89−43 =46
Advantage of the Range
The range is easy to compute.
Disadvantages of the Range
The range is not a reliable dispersion measure. It provides limited information about
the distribution because it uses only two data points.
86
© 2014-2024 AnalystPrep.The range is sensitive to outliers.
Mean Absolute Deviation (MAD)
MAD is a measure of dispersion representing the average of the absolute values of the
deviations of individual observations from the arithmetic mean. Therefore,
∑∣∣X
i
−X¯∣∣
MAD=
n
Remember that the sum of deviations from the arithmetic means is always zero, which is why we
use absolute values.
Example: Calculating Mean Absolute Deviation
Six financial analysts have reported the following returns on six different large-cap stocks over
2021:
{6% 7% 12% 2% 3% 11%}
Calculate the mean absolute deviation and interpret it.
Solution
First, we have to calculate the arithmetic mean:
(6%+7%+12%+2%+3%+11%)
X¯= = 6.83%
6
Next, we can now compute the MAD:
{|6%–6.83%|+|7%–6.83%|+|12%–6.83%|+|2%–6.83%|+|3%–6.83%|+|11%–6.83
MAD=

0.83+0.17+5.17+4.83+3.83+4.17
=
6
=3.17%
87
© 2014-2024 AnalystPrep.Interpretation: On average, an individual return deviates by 3.17% from the mean return of
6.83%.
Sample Variance and Sample Standard Deviation

instead of a population.
∑(X −X¯) 2
s2
=
i
n−1
Where:
X¯ = Sample mean.
n = Number of observations.

Assume that the returns realized in the previous example were sampled from a population
comprising 100 returns. The sample mean and the corresponding sample variance are closest to:

The sample mean will still be 6.83%.

Downside Deviation and Coefficient of Variation
When trying to estimate downside risk (i.e., returns below the mean), we can use the
following measures:
Semi-variance: The average squared deviation below the mean.
Semi-deviation (also known as semi-standard deviation): The positive square root of
semi-variance.
Target semi-variance: The sum of the squared deviations from a specific target
return.
Target semi-deviation: The square root of target semi-variance.
Sample Target Semi-Deviation
The target semi deviation, s , is calculated as follows:
Target
n (X i −B)2
s = ∑

for all Xi≤B
Where B is the target and n is the total number of sample observations.

Coefficient of Variation
90
© 2014-2024 AnalystPrep.The coefficient of variation, CV, is a measure of spread that describes the amount of variability
of data relative to its mean. It has no units, so we can use it as an alternative to the standard
deviation to compare the variability of data sets that have different means. The coefficient of
variation is given by:
s
CV =
X¯
Where:
s = Standard deviation of a sample.
X¯ = Mean of the sample.
Note: The formula can be replaced with ? when dealing with a population.
?
Procedure to Follow While Calculating the Coefficient of Variation:
1. Compute the mean of the data.
2. Calculate the sample standard deviation of the data set, s.
3. Find the ratio of s to the mean, x?.
Example: Coefficient of Variation
What is the relative variability for the samples 40, 46, 34, 35, and 45 of a population?

Interpreting the Coefficient of Variation
In finance, the coefficient of variation is used to measure the risk per unit of return. For
example, imagine that the mean monthly return on a T-Bill is 0.5% with a standard deviation of
0.58%. Suppose we have another investment, say, Y, with a 1.5% mean monthly return and
standard deviation of 6%; then,
0.58
CV T−Bill = =1.16
0.5
6
CV Y = =4
1.5
Interpretation: The dispersion per unit monthly return of T-Bills is less than that of Y.
Therefore, investment Y is riskier than an investment in T-Bills.

© 2014-2024 AnalystPrep.LOS 3c: interpret and evaluate measures of skewness and kurtosis to
address an investment problem
Since the deviations from the mean are squared when calculating variance, we cannot determine
whether significant deviations are more likely to be positive or negative. In order to identify
other crucial distributional traits, we must look beyond measures of central tendency, location,
and dispersion.
Skewness
Skewness refers to the degree of deviation from a symmetrical distribution, such as the normal
distribution. A symmetrical distribution has identical shapes on either side of the mean.
Distributions that are nonsymmetrical have unequal shapes on either side of the mean, leading to
skewness. This is because nonsymmetrical distributions depart from the usual bell shape of the
95
© 2014-2024 AnalystPrep.normal distribution.
Skewness can be positive, negative, or, in some cases, undefined. The shape of a skewed
distribution depends on outliers, which are extremely negative and positive observations.
Positive Skewness
A positively skewed distribution has a long right tail because of many outliers or extreme
values on the right side. Perhaps the best way to remember its shape is to consider its points in a
positive direction. Most data points are concentrated on the left side.
An example of a positively skewed distribution would be the income of individuals living in a
specific country.
Negative Skewness
A negatively skewed distribution has a long left tail resulting from many outliers on the left side
of the distribution. Therefore, we could say that it points in the negative direction. This is
96
© 2014-2024 AnalystPrep.because the right side harbors most of the data points.
Application of Skewness
Skewness matters in finance. Market data often show positive or negative skewness, like stock
prices or mortgage costs. Investors can predict if future prices will be above or below the mean
based on the skewness of the market segment.
Calculating Sample Skewness
The approximate sample skewness when sample is large (n≥100) is given by:
Skewness =( 1 ) ∑n i=1 (X i −X¯) 3
n s3
Where:
X¯ = Sample mean.
97
© 2014-2024 AnalystPrep.s = Sample standard deviation.
n = Number of observations.
A positive value indicates positive skewness. A 'zero' value indicates that the data is not skewed.
Lastly, a negative value indicates negative skewness or a negatively skewed distribution.
Example: Calculating Skewness
Suppose we have the following observations:
{12 13 54 56 25}
What is the skewness of the data?
Solution
First, we must determine the sample mean and the sample standard deviation:
(12+13+54+56+25) 160
X¯= = =32
5 5
(12−32)2+(13−32)2 +…(25−32)2
s2=
4
=467.5
Therefore,
s=√467.5= 21.62
Now we can work out the skewness:
Skewness =( 1 ) ∑n i=1 (X i −X¯) 3
n s3
1 (−20)3+(−19)3 +223+243 +(−7)3
Skewness =( )
5 21.623
Skewness =0.1835
Skewness is positive. Hence, the data has a positively skewed distribution.
98
© 2014-2024 AnalystPrep.Kurtosis
Kurtosis refers to the measurement of the degree to which a given distribution is more or less
'peaked' relative to the normal distribution. The concept of kurtosis is instrumental in decision-
making. In this regard, we have three categories of distributions:
Leptokurtic.
Mesokurtic.
Platykurtic.
Leptokurtic
A leptokurtic distribution is more peaked than the normal distribution. The higher peak results
from the clustering of data points along the x-axis. The tails are also fatter than those of a normal
distribution. The coefficient of kurtosis is usually more than 3.
The term "lepto" means thin or skinny. When analyzing historical returns, a leptokurtic
distribution means that small changes are less frequent since historical values are clustered
99
© 2014-2024 AnalystPrep.around the mean. However, there are also large fluctuations represented by the fat tails.
Platykurtic
A platykurtic distribution has extremely dispersed points along the x-axis, resulting in a lower
peak when compared to a normal distribution. "Platy" means broad. Hence, the prefix fits the
distribution's shape, which is wide and flat. The points are less clustered around the mean
compared to a leptokurtic distribution. The coefficient of kurtosis is usually less than 3.
Returns that follow this type of distribution have fewer major fluctuations compared to
leptokurtic returns. However, you should note that fluctuations represent the riskiness of an
asset. More fluctuations represent more risk and vice versa. Therefore, platykurtic returns are
less risky than leptokurtic returns.
Mesokurtic
Lastly, mesokurtic distributions have a curve that is similar to that of a normal distribution. In
other words, the distribution is mainly normal.
The majority of equity return series are found to have fat tails. Suppose a return distribution has
fat tails, and we apply statistical models that do not consider distribution. In that case, we will
overestimate the probability of either extremely poor or very favorable outcomes.
Investors often study a stock's daily trading volume distribution to assess its trading liquidity. It
helps them see if the market can handle a large trade in that stock. This is useful for investors
who want to make big investments or exit their positions in a particular stock.
Calculating Sample Kurtosis
Sample kurtosis is always measured relative to the kurtosis of a normal distribution, which is 3.
Therefore, we are always interested in the "excess "kurtosis, i.e.,
Excess kurtosis =Sample kurtosis–3
Where:
¯ 4

Positive excess kurtosis indicates a leptokurtic distribution. A zero value indicates a mesokurtic
distribution. Lastly, a negative excess kurtosis represents a platykurtic distribution.
Example: Calculating Kurtosis
Using the data from the example above (12, 13, 54, 56, and 25), determine the type of kurtosis
present.

Excess Kurtosis=2.2139
Since the excess kurtosis is negative, we have a platykurtic distribution.

The skewness of the normal distribution is most likely:
A. Zero.
B. Positive.
C. Negative.
Solution
The correct answer is A.
Since the normal curve is symmetric about its mean, its skewness is zero.
B is incorrect because a positively skewed distribution has positive skewness.
C is incorrect because a negatively skewed distribution has negative skewness.
Question 2
A frequency distribution in which there are too few scores at the extremes of the
distribution is most likely called:
A. Platykurtic.
B. Leptokurtic.
C. Mesokurtic.
Solution
The correct answer is A.
A platykurtic distribution has "thin" tails and is flatter compared to a normal
distribution. It implies that there are fewer scores at the extremes of the distribution,
which aligns with the question's description.

When most of the data are concentrated on the left of the distribution, it is most likely
called:
A. Symmetric distribution.
B. Positively skewed distribution.
C. Negatively skewed distribution.
Solution
The correct answer is B.
A distribution is said to be skewed to the right or positively skewed when most of the
data are concentrated on the left of the distribution. A distribution is said to be
skewed to the left or negatively skewed if most of the data are concentrated on the
right of the distribution. The left tail clearly extends farther from the distribution's
center than the right tail.
103
© 2014-2024 AnalystPrep.A is incorrect. A symmetric distribution is one in which the left and right sides
mirror each other.
C is incorrect. A distribution is said to be skewed to the left or negatively skewed if
most of the data are concentrated on the right of the distribution. The left tail extends
farther away from the mean than the right tail.

investment problem
Covariance
Covariance is a measure of how two variables move together. The sample
covariance of X and Y is calculated as follows:
∑N (X −X¯)(Y −Y¯)
i=1 i i
s XY =
n−1
The formula above implies that the sample covariance is the mean of the product of the
deviations in the two random variables and from their sample means.
If the covariance between two random variables is positive, it means they move in the same
direction. When one is below its mean, the other is also below its mean, and vice versa.
A major drawback of covariance is that it is difficult to interpret since its value can vary from
negative infinity to positive infinity.
Correlation
Correlation is a standardized measure of the linear relationship between two variables. It takes
the covariance and divides it by the product of the standard deviations of both variables. As a
result, its value ranges between -1 and +1 and is easier to interpret.
The sample correlation coefficient is calculated as follows:
S
r =
xy
xy
S ×S
x y
Where:
s = Covariance between variable X and Y.
XY

X
s = Standard deviation of variable Y.
Y
Properties of Correlation
Correlation ranges between -1 to +1 for two random variables, X and Y.
A correlation of 0 (uncorrelated variables) indicates no linear (straight line)
relationship exists between the variables.
106
© 2014-2024 AnalystPrep.A positive correlation close to +1 indicates a strong positive linear relationship.
A correlation of 1 indicates a perfect linear relationship.
A negative correlation close to -1 indicates a strong negative linear relationship.
A correlation of -1 indicates a perfect inverse linear relationship.
Limitations of Correlation Analysis
Two variables can have a very low correlation despite having a strong nonlinear
relationship.
Correlation can be an unreliable measure when outliers are present in the data.
Correlation does not imply causation. This implies that the correlation may be spurious.
A spurious correlation refers to:
Correlation between two variables due to chance relationships in a particular
dataset.
Correlation arising between variables when they are divided by a third
variable.
Correlation between two variables arising from their relation to a third
variable.
