Exchange traded derivatives provide guarantee through the use of their clearing house. Clearinghouses provide a guarantee to the winning party that if the loser does not pay, the clearinghouse will pay the winning party. Exchange-traded derivatives are therefore always standardized and backed by a clearinghouse. For this reason, they are highly liquid and offer no counterparty risk to traders.",

Market conditions, such as lack of demand or excessive supply, can still make it challenging to execute trades, even in a standardized market with market makers. The primary role of market makers is to provide liquidity, not to guarantee transactions. Although designated market makers help provide more predictable pricing by quoting buy and sell prices, they do not guarantee the price at which a derivative is traded. Market prices can fluctuate significantly due to changes in the underlying asset's value, market sentiment, or macroeconomic factors. Traders may still face slippage, which is the difference between the expected price of a trade and the price at which the trade is executed, especially in volatile market conditions.

In these transactions, the buyer pays the full cost of the asset at the time of purchase. Derivatives, on the other hand, are financial instruments whose value is derived from an underlying asset, such as a stock or commodity. Examples of derivatives include options and futures contracts. Compared to cash market transactions, derivatives are typically associated with lower initial costs. This is because when trading derivatives, investors are only required to put up a small percentage of the total value of the contract as collateral, known as the \"initial margin.\" This is in contrast to cash market transactions, where the full value of the asset must be paid upfront. Additionally, derivatives also have lower premiums compared to cash market transactions. Premiums refers to the upfront cost of an option or futures contract. This is because derivatives have a built-in leverage, allowing investors to gain exposure to the underlying asset at a fraction of the cost of buying it outright in the cash market. It's important to note that while the initial margin and premiums may be lower, derivatives also carry a higher level of risk, as the value of the contract is dependent on the performance of the underlying asset. It's important to understand the nature of the underlying asset, the terms and conditions of the derivatives contracts and the level of risk associated before investing in derivatives.

However, the frequency of gains and losses plays a crucial role in determining the actual profitability of engaging in call options.

Recall that a put option that is deep in the money means that the strike price is significantly above the current market price of the underlying asset. An increase in the risk-free interest rate tends to decrease the value of a put option. This is because the risk-free rate is a component of the option pricing models, such as the Black-Scholes model. Higher risk-free rates increase the cost of carrying the underlying asset, as it becomes more expensive to hold the asset when the returns from risk-free investments are higher. This makes the put option less attractive, as the opportunity cost of holding the asset rather than investing in risk-free securities increases. Additionally, the present value of the option's payoff decreases as the risk-free rate rises because the future payoff is discounted back at a higher rate. Similarly, increasing the time to expiration can have a complex effect on the value of a deep-in- the-money put option. While longer time frames generally increase the value of options due to the higher uncertainty and potential for the underlying asset's price to move in a favorable direction, for deep in-the-money put options, this effect might be offset by the time value decay and the increased cost of carry. The net effect tends to be negative, as the benefits of having more time for the asset price to decrease further (which would be beneficial for a put option) are outweighed by the costs associated with holding the option for a longer period.",

Example: Assume that the spot price of oil is $50 a barrel. The market would be said to be in contango if the futures price of oil two months from now is $55. In these circumstances, a trader could take the following actions: I. Borrow $50 at the risk-free rate. II. Buy oil today at $50 and sit on it for two months. III. Sell a futures contract for delivery two months out at $55. By locking in that profit at the higher price, and then sitting on the physical oil for a couple of months, a trader makes substantial gains.",
